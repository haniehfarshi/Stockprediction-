Thereâs been no evidence that the bank, which decides who gets an Apple Card and how much they can borrow, intentionally discriminated against women. But that may be the point, according to critics. The complex models that guide its lending decisions may inadvertently produce results that disadvantage certain groups.The problem -- in Washington itâs referred to as âdisparate impactâ -- is one the financial industry has spent years trying to address. The increasing use of algorithms in lending decisions has sharpened the years-long debate, as consumer advocates, armed with what they claim is supporting research, are pushing regulators and companies to rethink whether models are only entrenching discrimination that algorithm-driven lending is meant to stamp out.âBecause machines can treat similarly-situated people and objects differently, research is starting to reveal some troubling examples in which the reality of algorithmic decision-making falls short of our expectations, or is simply wrong,â Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, recently told Congress.Wozniak and David Heinemeier Hansson said on Twitter that their wives were given significantly lower limits on their Apple Cards, despite sharing finances and filing joint tax returns. Wozniak said he and his wife report the same income and have a joint bank account, which should mean that lenders view them as equals.One reason Goldman has become a poster child for the issue is that the Apple Card, unlike much of the industry, doesnât let households share accounts. That could lead to family members getting significantly different credit limits. Goldman says itâs considering offering the option.The bank said in a tweet it would also re-evaluate credit decisions if the borrowing limit is lower than the customer expected.âWe have not and never will make decisions based on factors like gender,â the company said. âIn fact, we do not know your gender or marital status during the Apple Card application process.âWith this monthâs snafu, Goldman has found itself in the middle of one of the thorniest laws in finance: the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The 1974 law prohibits lenders from considering sex or marital status and was later expanded to prohibit discrimination based on other factors including race, color, religion, national origin and whether a borrower receives public assistance.The issue gained national prominence in the 1970s when Jorie Lueloff Friedman, a prominent Chicago television anchor, began reporting on her own experience with losing access to some of her credit card accounts at local retailers after she married her husband, who was unemployed at the time. She ultimately testified before Congress, saying âin the eyes of a credit department, it seems, women cease to exist and become non-persons when they get married.âFTC WarningA 2016 study by credit reporting agency Experian found that women had higher credit scores, less debt, and a lower rate of late mortgage payments than men. Still, the Federal Trade Commission has warned that women may continue to face difficulties in getting credit.Freddy Kelly, chief executive officer of Credit Kudos, a London-based credit scoring startup, pointed to the gender pay gap, where women are typically paid less than men for performing the same job, as one reason lenders may be stingy with how much they let women borrow.Using complex algorithms that take into account hundreds of variables should lead to more just outcomes than relying on error-prone loan officers who may harbor biases against certain groups, proponents say.âItâs hard for humans to manually identify these characteristics that would make someone more creditworthy,â said Paul Gu, co-founder of Upstart Network Inc., a tech firm that uses artificial intelligence to help banks make loans.Upstart uses borrowersâ educational backgrounds to make lending decisions, which could run afoul of federal law. In 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told the company it wouldnât be penalized as part of an ongoing push to understand how lenders use non-traditional data for credit decisions.AI PushConsumer advocates reckon that outsourcing decision-making to computers could ultimately result in unfair lending practices, according to a June memorandum prepared by Democratic congressional aides working for the House Financial Services Committee. The memo cited studies that suggest algorithmic underwriting can result in discrimination, such as one that found black and Latino borrowers were charged more for home mortgages.Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, which launched an investigation into Goldmanâs credit card practices, described algorithms in a Bloomberg Television interview as a âblack box.â Wozniak and Hansson said they struggled to get someone on the phone to explain the decision.âAlgorithms are not only nonpublic, they are actually treated as proprietary trade secrets by many companies,â Rohit Chopra, an FTC commissioner, said last month. âTo make matters worse, machine learning means that algorithms can evolve in real time with no paper trail on the data, inputs, or equations used to develop a prediction.âVictims of discriminatory algorithms seldom if ever know they have been victimized,â Chopra said.(Updates with Goldman comments in ninth and 10th paragraphs.)To contact the reporters on this story: Shahien Nasiripour in New York at snasiripour1@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.net;Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Women also tend to hold more of their assets in cash rather than stocks and bonds, costing wealth and asset managers a potential $25 billion in fees.Apple Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were recently caught up in the growing debate about whether lenders unintentionally discriminate when they use algorithms to determine how Americans borrow money, after a viral tweet from a tech entrepreneur alleged gender discrimination in the new Apple Card.Read more: Apple Co-Founder Says Goldmanâs Apple Card Algo DiscriminatesThe problems are compounded by lack of women in senior management in the finance industry.

The person said TikTok is winding down its relationship with lobbyists at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP, which has close ties to Facebook.The relationship between Covington and Facebook was one reason for TikTokâs decision to break with the firm, the person said. Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan formerly co-chaired Covingtonâs data privacy and security practice. Facebook also hired Covington to help work on its anti-conservative bias report released in August. Covingtonâs Jon Kyl, a former Republican senator from Arizona, headed up that review.The lobbying push is part of TikTokâs effort to calm U.S. regulators and policy makers and try to persuade them that itâs really a U.S. company, said one of the people. Concerns are growing that TikTok could pose a national security threat because of its Chinese ownership and the risk that the government in Beijing could get access to the appâs growing troves of user data.Facebook has underscored Washingtonâs concerns about TikTok as it combats its own scrutiny from lawmakers and antitrust enforcers.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg insinuated during an October speech at Georgetown University that protesters in Hong Kong use Facebookâs WhatsApp messaging platform âdue to strong encryption and privacy protections,â whereas âmentions of these protests are censored, even in the U.S.â on TikTok.Monument Advocacy counts Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as clients, but doesnât work directly with Facebook, unlike other firms TikTok spoke with, the person said. Monument does represent an industry coalition on government surveillance that includes Facebook.TikTok, Monument and Facebook declined to comment. Covington didnât respond to requests for comment. The lobbying changes havenât yet been disclosed in public filings.ByteDance is expanding its operations aggressively across the U.S., hiring staff in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and New York. The app has logged more than 564 million installations this year and has been downloaded 1.45 billion times since launching, according to data from Sensor Tower, a San Francisco-based market intelligence firm that tracks the global app market.U.S. officials are reviewing whether ByteDanceâs $1 billion purchase of social media startup Musical.ly two years ago to merge it with TikTok poses a national security risk, Bloomberg News has reported. That panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, has toughened scrutiny of acquisitions of American companies under President Donald Trump and is paying closer attention to how deals can give foreign buyers access to data about U.S. citizens.âWe have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S.,â a TikTok representative said in a statement earlier this month.Lawmakers had pushed for a review, saying that TikTok poses a potential counterintelligence threat. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York wrote a letter with Republican Tom Cotton of Arkansas to U.S. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. They expressed concerns about foreign interference in American elections and the security of user data on the app, in addition to national security fears.The company was also the focus of a hearing earlier this month during which one Republican senator blasted it as a threat to global data security.âAll it takes is one knock on the door of their parent company, based in China, from a Communist Party official, for that data to be transferred to the Chinese governmentâs hands whenever they need it,â said Josh Hawley of Missouri, a frequent tech critic.TikTok has rejects the notion itâs controlled by the Chinese government or that U.S. user data is at risk.âWe are not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government,â the company wrote in a blog post last month. âTikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future.âByteDance, which began lobbying this summer, registered its in-house lobbyist Eric Ebenstein in June and brought on Covington in July, paying it $110,000 during the third quarter, according to federal disclosures. The company spent a total of $120,000 on lobbying from July through September.TikTok also announced last month that it had tapped another top legal and lobbying firm -- K&L Gates LLP -- to advise it on policies around transparency and content moderation, though the firm wonât be lobbying.Former Representative Bart Gordon, a Tennessee Democrat who led the House Science and Technology Committee, is on the account, as is former Republican Representative Jeff Denham, who represented a district in California.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner and Sarah Frier.To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net;Megan Wilson in Arlington at mwilson297@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Jillian Ward, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-11-12,262.2799,0.0,-262.2799,-1.0,nan,1,10,902,12,1.3303769401330376

But with key capabilities missing, many within the companyâs vast fan base have panned the application, prompting the appâs overseer to publicly defend his product.Scott Belsky, chief product officer of Adobeâs Creative Cloud division, tweeted about the âpainfulâ early reviews for a product his team has worked on for years. Right now in Appleâs App Store, Photoshop for iPad has a user review rating of 2.3 out of 5 stars. Belsky tweeted a screenshot of the metric, saying it made sense that a re-imagination of a popular 30-year-old product would displease many. Bloomberg News reported last month that the beta version of the touchscreen Photoshop app upset testers who missed many of the popular functions theyâd grown accustomed to over the years.âIf you try to make everybody happy w/ a v1, youâll either never ship or make nobody happy,â Belsky tweeted. âSuch feats require customer feedback to truly exceed expectations. You must ship and get fellow passionate travelers on board. But for a team with the right vision and commitment, being doubted and critiqued is motivating and informing.â Belsky also responded to users who tweeted about not enjoying Photoshop on Appleâs tablet, recommending they try Adobeâs drawing app, Fresco. While itâs hard, itâs important to build products âwith customersâ rather than âhidden in the lab,â he added.Read more: Adobe Pitches Illustrator, Photoshop for IPad Amid Slowing SalesAdobe has embarked on the arduous task of bringing its most successful software franchises to mobile devices to maintain its stature as the worldâs largest maker of creative software.

21,99,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-projects-strong-revenue-5g-211907723.html?.tsrc=rss,"Qualcomm Projects Strong Revenue, Suggesting Smartphone Gain",2019-11-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. gave a stronger-than-predicted forecast for the current quarter, indicating that smartphone demand -- fueled by new wireless technology -- may be picking slowly up after a prolonged slump. The companyâs shares rose in extended trading.Investors have been waiting to see whether Qualcomm, after five consecutive annual revenue declines, can parlay its claim of leadership in fifth generation, or 5G, wireless technology into a return to sales growth. While revenue is still declining from a year earlier, the market is stronger than feared and the company is poised to benefit from the rapid uptake of 5G early next year, Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview. Hitting the top end of its revenue range would provide the chipmaker with the first quarterly sales expansion in six quarters.âThereâs a lot of activity on 5G,â Mollenkopf said. âThe quarterly performance and the forecast reflects âour confidence in the inflection point of 5G next year.âFiscal first-quarter revenue will be $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion, the San Diego-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That mid-point of the estimate, $4.8 billion, compares with an average of analystsâ projections of $4.78 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit and revenue in the fourth quarter topped estimates.Qualcomm, whose chips are the main component in most of the worldâs smartphones, has suffered shrinking revenue as consumers hang on to their handsets longer. In China, Huawei Technologies Co., which supplies itself with the majority of its crucial components, has been gaining market share, hurting demand for Qualcomm chips used by Huaweiâs rivals. The new services are debuting this year with handsets from Samsung Electronics Co. that will take advantage of the faster downloads and response times offered by the upgraded networks. Mollenkopf said that there are now 230 5G phone models designed on the companyâs chips, up from 150 three months ago.After shrinking to as low as 1.7 billion units in 2019, the smartphone market will rebound next year, Qualcomm said. The company expects shipments as high as 1.85 billion units in 2020, including as many as 225 million 5G handsets.Cristiano Amon, the head of Qualcommâs chip unit, called that 5G estimate conservative. If consumers decide to upgrade phones more often, that number could go up, he said on a conference call with analysts.âThe company is clearly pinning future growth on 5G playing out very well with extremely high adoption among consumers,â said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Logan Purk. âWe just question how quick the uptake will be. There will be plenty of adopters that will pick it up. It will generate some sort of refresh but at the end of the day itâs not proven technology.âA renewed supply relationship with Apple Inc. for future versions of the iPhone and 5G high-speed networks and phones are causing optimism that the companyâs financial performance will improve.Qualcomm still needs to resolve its ongoing technology licensing dispute with Huawei and succeed in its appeal against a sweeping antitrust ruling from a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The company has ongoing talks but isnât in a position to report any progress, Mollenkopf said. A trade agreement between China and the U.S. might help, he said.Separately, the company said it appointed Akash Palkhiwala as chief financial officer. He has been serving as the interim CFO since August.Qualcomm shares rose about 5% in extended trading after closing at $84.63 in New York. The stock has gained 49% this year, about equal to the rise in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.Net income rose to $506 million, or 42 cents a share, in the period ended Sept. 29, from a loss of $513 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, profit was 78 cents a share, compared with an average estimate of 71 cents. Revenue declined 17% to $4.81 billion. Analysts on average had predicted $4.71 billion in sales.Qualcomm is unique in the chip industry because the company gets the bulk of its profit from licensing patents that it says cover the fundamentals of all modern phone systems. The majority of Qualcommâs revenue comes from selling chips that run phones and connect them to cellular networks.Technology licensing revenue was up 4% in the quarter from a year earlier to $1.16 billion in the quarter, providing $792 million of profit before taxes, Qualcomm said. Both totals increased from a year ago but declined from the prior quarter. The chip division provided $3.61 billion in revenue and $499 million of profit. Revenue was down 22% from a year ago and profit slid 37%.While Qualcomm settled its broad-ranging legal dispute with Apple and the iPhone maker agreed to resume using its chips, the company lost an FTC case that alleged unfair business practices and has been ordered to renegotiate patent licenses. Qualcomm is appealing the decision and seeking a stay on the decision so it doesnât have to immediately start those renegotiations.(Updates with comments from analyst in the eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-11-05,257.13,257.24,0.11,0.00042779900000000003,Don't move,5,50,864,60,6.944444444444445

The smartphone market is saturated and growing slowly at best, so Apple must find new ways to persuade consumers to upgrade their iPhones and sell them digital services and accessories.Fiscal fourth-quarter results, reported Wednesday, suggested the strategy is beginning to work. While iPhone revenue dropped 9%, overall sales rose and the company forecast more top-line growth for the key holiday period. The shares gained 1.6% to $247.14 as the market opened Thursday, valuing the company at $1.1 trillion.Services and accessory revenue jumped to records as users bought apps for their existing iPhones, attached wearable devices like AirPods and Apple Watches, and subscribed to services like Apple Music and iCloud storage.But the plan will only keep working if the installed base of active Apple devices grows steadily, led by the iPhone. That will be a challenge because consumers arenât upgrading to newer handsets as often as they once did. Over the last three years, the average age of a smartphone has increased more than three months to 19.5 months, according to research by UBS. In a survey by the investment bank, respondents said they plan to replace their devices every 28.5 months, or almost two-and-a-half years.During a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri described a potential solution to this upgrade problem: A new feature for the Apple Card that lets users pay for their iPhones over 24 months with no interest and manage that payoff program directly from their iPhone.âOne of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things,â Cook said. âWe are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that in the receipt of new products.âThe CEO did brag about the latest iPhoneâs camera, but conversation soon turned to more prosaic topics. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty asked whether it was realistic to expect the iPhone business to return to growth in 2020. Cook refused to be drawn into a long-term prediction but said he was encouraged by the initial reaction to the new phones.When asked about about China, Cook said new iPhone pricing, a monthly payment program and trade-in offers have helped to improve performance in the country.Other analysts asked whether offering Appleâs new TV+ streaming service free for a year with a new device purchase was the start of a broader bundling of hardware and services. Cook said he wanted to grow the TV+ audience quickly and saw this as a way to do it. He wouldnât rule out attaching another free service offer to hardware purchases in the future.Maestri said Apple is continuing to push its trade-in program, which lets users bring in an old iPhone for a credit toward a new model. Sales volume through that program is five times larger than in the fiscal fourth quarter last year, the CFO noted.Cook also indicated that wearables continue to keep the Apple ecosystem strong. He said three-fourths of Apple Watch purchases in the fiscal fourth-quarter were by users who had never bought that device before. The CEO wouldnât say how those sales were driven by existing iPhone owners, but the underlying message was clear: Wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods keep people tied to their iPhones and help Apple to squeeze more money of a product thatâs still struggling to grow.(Updates with share trading in third paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-31,248.76,255.82,7.06,0.028380769,Buy,20,38,667,78,11.694152923538232

Samsung Electronics Co., taking advantage of the lull, introduced a plethora of cheaper high-volume models to grow sales 11%, while a strong home market drove Huawei Technologies Co. shipments 29% higher.The global smartphone market is showing signs of life after users replaced aging devices and demand from markets such as India surged with the proliferation of low-priced plans. On Thursday, Samsung reported a 32% jump in operating income at its mobile division, while Appleâs holiday-quarter outlook trumped analystsâ expectations. The Korean company retained global leadership while Chinese rival closed the gap, thanks to pent-up demand that built up during the previous quarter when Washington blacklisted the networking giant. Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo rounded out the top five.The prognosis for Huawei however is uncertain given the Trump Administration put it on the U.S. Entity List, which prohibits it from using the latest Android versions in new devices. Shipments to its home market surged 66% in the quarter but only rose about 18% sequentially abroad, and many analysts foresee a drop in overall international sales because of its inability to access American software and circuitry.âHuawei is not out of the woods yet,â said Canalys Senior Analyst Ben Stanton. âIt will be a major challenge to retain its overseas volume if the Entity List saga is not resolved in the coming months.âRead more: Samsung Profit Beats on Strength of Smartphones and Displays(Updates with Canalysâs comments from the second paragraph.

Samsung, which reported a 56% slump in operating profit earlier this month, said it expects memory chip demand to gradually climb out of its funk in the fourth quarter and bounce back next year. The company foresees capital spending of 29 trillion won in 2019, about the same level as it was last year.Memory chip prices have stabilized and risen in part for seasonal reasons and in part because clients are buying to hedge against global macroeconomic uncertainty, said Samsung. Chipmakers such as SK Hynix Inc. have recently said the industry is bottoming out and is now on the verge of an upturn thanks to the adoption of new technologies such as fifth-generation networking.âWe are seeing an improvement in the chip industry,â Kim Woon-ho, an analyst at IBK Securities Co., said in an Oct. 22 note. âIt is expected that the DRAM prices will start to recover in the third quarter of 2020. We project a big jump in demand for server chips, while Fold models will become a new factor.âWhat Bloomberg Intelligence SaysSamsungâs semiconductor profit will likely keep falling through early next year, despite optimism surrounding an upturn in the memory cycle.&#92;--Anthea Lai, TMT analyst. Click here for the research.Samsungâs smartphone business, which has weathered a series of setbacks in recent years, remained strong in the quarter, accruing 85 million unit sales in the third quarter. The recent Galaxy Note 10 flagship exceeded the sales of the previous yearâs Note in the same period by âdouble digits,â according to the company, however Samsung is forecasting profitability of its mobile business will decline in the current quarter as itâll need to ramp up marketing to prop up demand.The troubles faced by rival Huawei Technologies Co. in international markets have helped bolster Samsungâs mobile sales, with Counterpoint Research indicating that Samsung is absorbing Android users in major European countries, South America and the Middle East.Apple Inc.âs in-demand iPhone 11 is revitalizing demand for the Korean companyâs most advanced displays. Samsung notes a âsustained drop in average selling price and demand for TV panels,â however its smaller smartphone displays are keeping that division buoyant and the company predicts robust demand as consumers look to upgrade their devices. 5G networking will help drive an upgrade cycle, says Samsung, and the rapid move to 5G in its home market has already contributed to its bottom line.Samsungâs Stock Is Signaling a Bottom for the Global Chip MarketSamsung shares have risen more than 30% this year, while the benchmark KOSPI has inched up 2%.(Updates with details from earnings call from second paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-31,248.76,255.82,7.06,0.028380769,Buy,6,31,524,43,8.206106870229007

They also tell us how tough it is to turn things around when business is being challenged on multiple fronts.The South Korean electronics giant posted a 56% drop in third-quarter operating incomeÂ and a 5% fall in sales. That profit figure was 11% higher than analysts had expected, which is nothing to sneeze at, but it doesnât paper over the fact that this wasÂ the fourth straight quarter of declines on both fronts. Both figures were previously reported in a preliminary announcement earlier this month.Companies from Apple Inc. to Sony Corp. are facing a slowdown in sales of smartphones and consumer electronics as theÂ U.S.-China trade war and the slowing global economy prompt consumers to tighten spending. Samsung gets hit by that twice over: shipments of its own devices, and sales of components that go into other companiesâ products.Profit from the semiconductor business, which makes both memory chips and logic processors, fell 78% toÂ 3.05 trillion won ($2.6 billion), the lowest in over three years, SamsungÂ said in Thursdayâs earnings statement. This is a particularly brutal outcomeÂ because chips accounted for 76% of operating profit last year. And, according to its own account,Â the challenge isÂ likely to continue this quarter.Â Â The Company expects demand for components to turn sluggish in general amid weak seasonal effects, while marketing expenses are likely to increase to address year-end smartphone sales.That second part is worth particular attention. While Samsung has previously shown its readiness to be pragmatic on capital expenditureÂ to adjust for the recent slowdown, it also appears willing to double down on marketing to juice sales of its branded products, such as the Galaxy series of handsets.Samsungâs IT and mobile business, which primarily consists of smartphones, was one of the few shining lights in theÂ quarter. Revenue climbed 17.4%, the strongest growth in six quarters,Â to 29.3 trillion won, just a hair less than the 30 trillion record it set in the second quarter of 2017. The difference between now and then, though, is the margin. For almost the same sales figure, Samsung squeezed out 27% less profit this time thanÂ two years ago.Higher marketing costs could again take the shine off the handset businessÂ in the fourthÂ quarter, which Samsung admitted will see shipments declineÂ after the post-launch honeymoon of the latest two Galaxy models ends. The elephant in that room is especially stiff competition from Apple Inc.âs latest iPhone and GoogleâsÂ new Pixel, both of which are getting rave reviews.Sales of Samsungâs new flagship Galaxy S10Â wereÂ likely aided by Huawei Technologies Inc.âs troubleÂ sellingÂ outside of China. That helped the South Korean company ship 85 million units in the third quarter, slightly ahead of a year ago. The fourth-quarter decline inÂ shipments will be accompanied by fallingÂ average prices forÂ the high-end models.Samsung has also being showing off gimmicky new folding displays â remember the Fold? âÂ as a way to flex its technology muscles, but don't expect those to do much to fill in the revenue gaps.Investors who truly believe in Samsung will be holding on to signals that the memory-chip business is ready to turn around. Thatâs possible, but then again SamsungÂ is doing its best to tame expectations: âUncertainties linger over the memory chip market as demand is seen recovering but risks from global industry circumstances persist.âThis leaves management with little other ammunition to handle the slump than to rein in spending, whichÂ I have applauded in the past.Â But thatÂ isnât a business model, itâs a coping strategy. Which tells you that all Samsung can do in this slowdown is manageÂ as best it can.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

No serious media investor is going to front that sort of cash.Gambling that a deep-pocketed billionaire somewhere wants to exert outsized influence on the negotiations to exit the European Union looks like the best hope for the Barclay brothers to recoup the purchase price of 665 million pounds ($854 million), as the Financial Times has reported is their goal.The Barclays bought the newspaper when the market was in much better shape. In the middle of the last decade, Britain's 10 daily national newspapers sold a cumulative 11.2 million copies and attracted about a quarter of advertising spending, according to Department for Media, Culture and Sport figures from 2007. By 2017, circulation had fallen to 6.1 million copies, and just 6% of advertising went to the print editions of newspapers, as Google and Facebook Inc. gobbled up ad dollars and readership shifted online.Itâs hard to see how a strategic buyer such as Daily Mail and General Trust Plc, which has said itâs on the prowl, could justify paying such an exorbitant fee for a business in structural decline. There are good reasons why bringing the Daily Mail and Telegraph under one roof might make sense â both are right-of-centerÂ and some operational costs could be shared. But Paul Zwillenberg, the chief executive officer of theÂ Daily Mail and General Trust,Â  has been adamant that he wonât overpay for media assets.Even with adjustments for one-time items, operating profit at the Telegraph Media Group Ltd., parent of both the daily newspaper and its Sunday stablemate, fell to 7.8 million pounds last year. Back in 2004, the year in which David and Frederick Barclay bought it, the company enjoyed 32 million pounds of operating profit.Daily Mail and General Trust commands an enterprise value that's just over 12 times last year's operating profit. Taking that as the yardstick, the Telegraph would be valued at less than 100 million pounds based on last year's performance. That rather generously ignores the fact that DMGT these days generates less than half of profit from its media business.How might the Telegraph be worth the reported 665 million pounds sought? That would need high confidence that its turnaround, initiated by CEO Nick Hugh, is set to accelerate rapidly â that the low numbers of 2018 reflect increased spending that will boost growth. Or a buyer might eye the scope to cut a lot of duplicate costs. If the Daily Mail and the Telegraph were to join forces, the cost base from their combined media operations would be some 850 million pounds.Cutting that outlay by 7% would add 60 million pounds to operating profit and more easily justify the Barclays' target price, but doing so could prove challengingÂ given the extent to which costs have already been pared at both companies. More realistically, were the Telegraph's profit to return to 2017 levels, a valuation nearing 200 million pounds would seem more appropriate.SoÂ the only way for the owners toÂ achieve their asking price would likely be to find a billionaire whoâs looking for much more than the typical vanity purchase, and is truly keen to sway how discussions to leave the EU evolve. Even if Britainâs initial deal to leave the trading bloc passes parliament by the end of January, there could be a transition period of negotiations stretching to the end of 2022.Despite their declining readership, the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph remain hugely influential on the right of British politics. Before becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson himself was a weekly columnist for the daily newspaper.In the U.S., a handful of storied publications have been snapped up by billionaire benefactors: Salesforce.com Inc. founder Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne bought Time magazine for $190 million last year; Amazon.com Inc. billionaire Jeff Bezos snapped up The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013; and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve, secured control of the Atlantic magazine last year. In each case, however, the valuation was far more realistic given the evolution of the news industry.At any rate, there are probably cheaper ways to influence the debate in the U.K. And itâs hard to see how a buyer pursuing a single-issue agenda would be good for quality journalism.If the Barclay brothers do indeed need to sell the newspaper to fund other businesses, as the Financial Timesâs report on Sunday suggested, then they will need to be realistic about the asking price.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

But thatâs far from true.The list of reasons stocks should be down is much longer than the one for why they should be up. The economy has slowed, and a majority of chief financial officers anticipate a recession within a year. Earnings have stopped growing, and estimates are being cut. Stock valuations are high. The U.S.-China trade war has not been resolved. Congress has started an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy, but thatâs only because the outlook has deteriorated.So why are equities roaring ahead? The answer comes down to a handful of stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Oracle Corp. Those five companies account for half of the S&P 500 tech sector, which has surged 30.2% for the year. Exclude that sector and the S&P 500 would be up only about 14%, according to DataTrek Research. Thatâs still good but nothing special when compared with the returns in the rest of the world, with the MSCIÂ All-Country World Index excluding the U.S.Â having gained 12%.Therein lies the hidden risk embedded in the market, which is that any missteps by any of these highfliers could spell doom for equities more broadly. It also underscores just how lacking in breadth this latest leg up has been. For one, the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closing above their 200-day moving averages has dropped to 53% from 59% in mid-September.Not only that, but the spread between the share of S&P 500 members closing at 52-week highs and the share at 52-week lows has been in a general downtrend since June.To be sure, itâs not unusual that a handful of stocks have led the broader market higher. Before this year, it was the FAANGÂ group of stocks: Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and a few others.Â A few years ago, AQR Capital Managementâs co-founder and chief investment officer, Clifford Asness, published a paper examining the impact of individual stocks on the S&P 500 from 1994 to 2014. What he found was that while the S&P 500 rose 9.3% a year, the top 10 stocks accounted for 4.1 percentage points of thatÂ gain on average.Then thereâs the awkward fact that smaller stocks that make up the vast majority of the market are down about 11% from their records reached in August 2018 based on the S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000 indexes.This stock market has delivered plenty of surprises, and betting against it has been a losing proposition. In January, when the S&P 500 was trading at about 2,600, the median estimate of about 25Â Wall Street strategist surveyed by Bloomberg was for it to end the year at 2,913. It surpassed that level in April and ended Friday at 3,203. But those same strategists are more cautious, predicting the benchmark to drop to 3,000 by theÂ end of the year.Of course, they could raise their forecasts, but that would be awkward given the trend in profits and the slowing economy. Third-quarter earnings areÂ tracking at a 3% decline from a year earlier, and forecasts for the fourth quarter have been cut to a gain of 1.2% from the 5.4% increase that was forecast at the end of July, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. The S&P 500âs price-to-earnings ratio, at just shy of 20 times, is the highest since last October, just as the benchmark was beginning a tumble that led to a 14% drop in the final three months of the year.All that suggests investors need to look beyond the headlines about yet another record.To contact the author of this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is an editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

Now It Needs to Nail HBO Max.,2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- AT&T Inc. is one of the worldâs biggestÂ communications companies, but it hasnât always been great atÂ communicating. On Monday, management sought to change that, providing investors with some of the clarity theyâve needed to get comfortable once again with an industry giant thatâs so much more complex today that it was just a couple of years ago. Itâs the right message. Now AT&T, the parent of the eponymousÂ wireless network, as well as the DirecTV satellite serviceÂ and media properties includingÂ HBO, needs to put its words into action.Â Alongside the release of third-quarter earnings, AT&T outlined some of its most detailed financial projections and capital-return goals yet, promising to retire all of the debt it incurredÂ to buy Time Warner last year and buy back about 70% of the shares it issued for the $102Â billion deal. The company said profit margins, as measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be unchanged next year as it invests in HBO Max, its version of Netflix launching in the spring, but that margins willÂ begin to grow in 2021 amid cost cuts and growth in its wireless and MexicanÂ divisions. AT&T also committed to hit the pause button on major acquisitions and continue evaluating assets that can be carved out to raise money, such as the sale-leaseback agreement it struck for its wireless towers last week.Â Â This is largely what investors, championed by activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp., have been waiting to hear for some time. âIt is clear to us that AT&T is committed to and accountable for creating shareholder value over the near- and long-term,â Elliottâs Jesse Cohn and Marc Steinberg, who led the activist push, said in a subsequent statement Monday, signaling a truce between the investor and AT&T.Â While AT&Tâs announcement contained important concrete data forecasts, the more abstract takeaways of its investor day on Tuesday may be what really sets the toneÂ for the foreseeable future. The event, hosted by AT&Tâs WarnerMedia unit (the former Time Warner),Â is primarily to give a sneak peek at HBO Max, which has become something of a mythical creature in the streaming wars. Itâs received as much or more news coverage and scrutiny than Walt Disney Co.âs Disney+ and Apple Inc.âs Apple TV+ apps, even though HBO Max is still only in the development stage and no one outside the company has seen it yet. Disney+ and Apple TV+ both launch in November, making HBO Max a very late-comer to the market.Â AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson added Warner and DirecTV to the companyâs repertoire to better capitalize on consumersâ voracious appetite for streaming video. But instead of the accolade expected of aÂ visionary thinker, Stephenson and his team have been criticized for what started to feel like an incoherent strategy. Heading into 2019, the companyâs mountain of debt âÂ it isÂ the worldâs biggest corporate borrower âÂ began to look like such a burden that it might put its all-important dividend into jeopardy or forceÂ a sale of DirecTV. But to Stephensonâs credit, he quickly chipped away at the debt by selling off a series of assets and those fears have largely been abated.Now itâs a question of whether he can get all of the different piecesÂ of AT&T working together, a task assigned to his deputy, John Stankey, a three-decade veteran of AT&T who was installed asÂ the CEO of WarnerMedia and also recently promoted to chief operating officer of the parent company. While Stankey has been seen as Stephensonâs most likely successor amid whispers that a change at the top was nearing, AT&T clarified on Monday that a CEO transition is ânot expected in 2020.â Elliottâs own statement summarizing the agreement had this relevant detail: When Stephenson does retire, the chairman and CEO roles will be split and a broader search will be run for his replacement.This is all a step in the right direction, but in the backdrop of Mondayâs positive news were less inspiring third-quarter results from AT&T. They were a reminder that AT&Tâs best business is still its core business, U.S. wireless service, and that cord-cutting is taking a harsh toll on traditional pay-TV revenues. Hanging in the balance is the HBO Max unveiling Tuesday. If it goes half as well as Disneyâs own investor streaming party went in April then AT&T, at least perceptually, will be in good shape. If it doesnât live up to expectations, it will be a long road till the spring launch.Â To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

130,314,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-revamping-smart-home-efforts-103027496.html?.tsrc=rss,"Apple Revamping Smart Home Efforts After Falling Behind Amazon, Google",2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is ramping up hiring for a team that is working on new smart-home software and devices in an effort to catch up in a field where Google and Amazon.com Inc.Â have dominated, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The company is seekingÂ engineers to work in its Cupertino, California,Â headquarters and in San Diego as part of a group revamping AppleâsÂ smart-home platform. The overhaul is designed to spurÂ more outside accessory and appliance makers to connect smart-home products such as lights and garage doorsÂ with the iPhone and Appleâs voice-activated digital assistant, Siri. The team also is exploring the possibility ofÂ building new home devices beyond the HomePod speaker.The effort is headed by Andreas Gal, the former Mozilla chief technology officer who joined Apple last year when his company Silk Labs was acquired by the iPhone maker. Gal is leading the software side of the team reporting to Arun Mathias, a lieutenant to software chief Craig Federighi, whoÂ oversees wireless software engineering. Silk Labs developed an artificial intelligence-based platform for linking together internet-connected devices.Apple has posted 15 job listings on its website since last month for engineers to work on the companyâs platform, called HomeKit, smart-home devicesÂ and related softwareÂ and has shared other listings on third-party job boards. The company has also been privately recruiting potential candidates from the internet-connected devices industry. AppleÂ already has hired several new engineers and managers this year from Amazon, Qualcomm Inc. and other companies.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment aboutÂ the companyâs plans.Gaining a foothold inÂ the smart-home market is critical for Apple as it looks for new offerings beyond the iPhone and seeks ways to keep people buying its products and services. The companyÂ first dipped its toeÂ into the areaÂ in 2014 with the launch of HomeKit, a Siri-connected platform that connects smart-home devices to Apple products like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and HomePod. Apple offers a Home app on most of its devices, letting users lock and unlock doors, connect to sprinklers, open blinds, and control media on TVs and speakers using its AirPlay protocol. While Amazon and Google have opened up their Alexa and Google Assistant to third-party products, the Siri voice assistant is only available on Apple devices, but it can control third-party products via HomeKit.Appleâs HomePod, its one home device other than the Apple TV, hasnât gained widespread popularity with consumers due to its price, reliance on Apple servicesÂ and smaller base of connectable smart devices. Apple has focused on mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches as well as computers, and Amazon and Google have shown little to no ability to compete with Apple in those areas.Appleâs two smart-home devices compareÂ with dozens of offerings like the Echo and Nest Hub Max from Amazon and Google, respectively. More importantly, Amazon and Googleâs smart-home ecosystems are far larger than Appleâs. Apple lists about 450 compatible HomeKit devices on its website from third-party device makers. Amazon says that Alexa works with 85,000 smart-home products from 9,500 manufacturers and that consumers have linked tens of millions of home devices to Alexa. Google says its home platform works with more thanÂ 10,000 devices from 1,000 brands. Appleâs approval process for third-party accessories is known to be stricter than others.Appleâs HomePod speaker has 5% market share compared withÂ 70% for Amazon smart speakers and 20% for Google speakers, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The Apple TV set-top box, in addition to Googleâs Chromecast, has fallen far behind Roku Inc. and Amazon in TV appliances. In the overall smart-speaker market, according to International Data Corp., Apple has only 2% share compared to 25% for Amazon and 22% for Google, including the companiesâ ownÂ products and third-party devices.Some of Appleâs job listings mention supply chain expertise and developing wireless, battery-powered devices with camera modules, indicating exploration into new home appliances. Apple has said it plans to release a new cloud storage feature for security cameras later this year, which could potentially play into the companyâsÂ future plans. A few years ago, teams inside Apple explored creating a wide range of smart-home accessories, such as modules for opening and closing windows, cabinets, and doors, but those efforts were put on hold, according to a person with knowledge of the work.Appleâs smart-home initiative is one of a few major projects underway at the company. Apple also has teams working on self-driving car technology, an augmented-reality headset that could debut as early as next year, an iPhone with support for 5G networks for next yearÂ and Mac computers that run on custom Apple chips rather than processors from Intel Corp.To contact the author of this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew Pollack at apollack1@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzTom GilesFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-28,249.05,243.29,-5.76,-0.023127886,Sell,24,18,788,66,8.375634517766498

Once investors got a good look at its finances they couldn't stop laughing. The company instead needed a bailout from its biggest investor and now is valued, perhaps optimistically, at $8 billion.Maybe this episode marks the beginning of a sobering up of cash-burning growth companies with dismal unit economic. If that's the case, what will that processÂ look like? Maybe the transformation of music-streaming service Pandora helps show how busted unicorns â closely held startups valued at $1 billion or more â can find new life. QuicktakeUnicornsWhen Pandora had itsÂ initial public offering in 2011, it was a tortoise-beats-the-hare success story, after it launched during the dot-com boom in 2000.Â It survived several near-death experiences, putting a damper on the cockiness and growth-at-all-costs mentality often seen in fast-growing startups. Rather than grant its chief executive officer super-voting shares and complete control, the CEOÂ owned less than 3% of its stockÂ after several rounds of capital injection that diluted his stake.One can't fault investors for enthusiasm during Pandora's first few years as a publicly traded company. Between the fiscal years ended in 2010 and 2013 itÂ increased its active user base from 16 million to 65.6 million. Annual revenue rose from $55 million to $427 million, much of it driven by ad revenue. The company was still losing money, but it appeared to be manageable. The story was that over time it could convert users into paying monthly subscribers while negotiating better royalty rates on content, leading to margin expansion and profits down the road. When the stock peaked in early 2014, the company had a valuation of $9 billion, or roughly 10 times the $920 million in revenue it would go on to generate that year.That's when the downward spiral of slowing growth, increased competition and a falling stock price began. After more than doubling in 2014, revenue only grew by 26% in 2015. Spotify became the new darling for music streaming, and other companies such as Apple joined a never-ending parade of entrants into the market. Profit margins eroded along with the slowing revenue growth. Between its 2014 peak and the end of May 2017, Pandora's stock price fell by 78%.The following month was the beginning of the end of Pandora's life as an independent company afterÂ Sirius XM Holdings Inc. invested $480 million for a 19% stake. Pandora divested its share of Ticketfly, a noncore business, at a loss as it sought to preserve cash. In January 2018 itÂ cut 5% of its headcount and moved other employees to AtlantaÂ from Oakland, California, in a cost-saving move. Eight months later,Â Sirius bought the whole companyÂ for $3 billion in an all-stock deal that was worth about a third of the company's peak valuation.Sirius made a good marriage partner for Pandora investors for a few reasons. Pandora had tens of millions of active users, but unlike Sirius it had not been very successful at converting them into paying subscribers. By buying Pandora, Sirius now had access to a huge audience of music streamers who might become future subscribers. Pandora also had technology that was useful to Sirius, and the combined entity was able to eliminate duplicate positions.So far, it seems to be going as planned. In its second-quarter earnings report, Sirius said that Pandora's revenue increased by 15% while costs only grew by 4%, leading to 40% growth in gross profit. Although it wasn't successful as an independent company, Pandora still has 65 million monthly active users and is an increasingly profitable part of a $29 billion parent company.The lesson here is that when a startup grows quickly, investors often are willing to overlook all sorts of flaws as long as they buy into the long-term vision of a company, whether that's dominating commercial real-estate leasing or music streaming. But when growth slows and cash runs low those growth investors will abandon ship, forcing companies to pitch a value proposition to very different types of investors. Some companies might be able to become profitable in their own right, but for others it might mean seeking out a buyer. Pandora's salvation was having tens of millions of users and technology desired by a competitor. Investors who bought the stock in those heady days in 2014 were never made whole, but five years later the business still exists, albeit in a different form, continuing to provide a service that generates revenue.The high-profile reversal of fortune suffered by WeWork in the public eye over the past few months is leading people to wonder how many other potential disasters loom for closely held money-losing growth companies. But as Pandora shows, although valuations may not recover, that doesn't mean these companies are necessarily doomed.To contact the author of this story: Conor Sen at csen9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Over his decade-long career at Apple, he was one of the most senior executives, reporting directly to the general counsel.Levoff, who served as Appleâs senior director of corporate law, is accused of repeatedly trading on information about revenue and earnings dating back to 2011. The illegal investments led to about $227,000 in profits, while allowing him to avoid $377,000 of losses, according to prosecutors in Newark, New Jersey.In one example, detailed in the SECâs case, Levoff learned that Apple wouldnât meet analystsâ third-quarter forecast for iPhone sales in July 2015 and sold about $10 million of Apple stock, or almost all of his holdings, allowing him to avoid losing about $345,000 when the companyâs shares plunged more than 4% after announcing its numbers.âWe look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Levoff with respect to these allegations,â his lawyer, Kevin Marino, said in an e-mail.The allegations were a black eye for Apple, which said after Levoff was charged that it was reviewing policies implemented to prevent illicit share transactions. The company has had a mostly clean record on financial reporting issues since shareholders accused its co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs of options backdating in the mid 2000s. A special board committee led by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore cleared Jobs of misconduct.Levoff was responsible for making sure that employees complied with the companyâs insider-trading policy, and implemented an update of the procedures in 2015, the SEC said in its suit. He even sent an email to workers -- in all capital letters -- in 2011 reminding them that they werenât permitted to trade shares based on non-public information.As a member of Appleâs âdisclosure committee,â he had permission to review quarterly and annual reports, and press statements before they were released to the public. Prosecutors said he would read through internal documents he obtained as a member of that group and make trades in his personal brokerage account at TD Ameritrade.(Updates with background.)To contact the reporter on this story: Chris Dolmetsch in Federal Court in Manhattan at cdolmetsch@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Joe SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-23,243.18,243.58,0.4,0.0016448720000000001,Don't move,4,13,421,21,4.98812351543943

171,421,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-display-supplier-sees-oled-210000131.html?.tsrc=rss,iPhone Display Supplier Sees OLED Smartphone Deluge From 2021,2019-10-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan Display Inc., the struggling supplier of mobile screens to Apple Inc., says it has about a year before it needs to decide on whether to take a plunge on next-generation organic light-emitting diode displays.While OLED panels are slimmer, more energy-efficient and offer higher contrast, JDIâs liquid crystal displays will retain a price advantage that keeps them competitive in smartphones through 2021, the companyâs new Chief Executive Officer Minoru Kikuoka said in an interview. He anticipates a more decisive shift to the new technology may occur in that time period, declining to elaborate on plans of specific customers.When Apple launched its first OLED iPhone in 2017, it was seen as the beginning of the end for the LCDâs long reign. For Japan Display, which relies on Apple for a large portion of its revenue, that spelled trouble because the company was falling behind in the development of the new screens. But the iPhone X, which used an OLED display from Samsung Electronics Co., didnât sell as well as anticipated, and Apple followed up a year later with an LCD-based addition to its lineup with the iPhone XR -- giving the Japanese company some breathing room.Samsung Is Pouring $11 Billion Into Next-Generation DisplaysWith the smartphone market plateauing and fancier screens failing to ratchet up demand from users already content with their existing devices, value for money has once again risen in importance for people considering a new purchase, according to the CEO.âWe are seeing consumers put more emphasis on affordability when it comes to their smartphone preferences,â Kikuoka said. âThe industry is now gaining a new appreciation for the kind of price competitiveness offered by the LCDs.âAppleâs 2019 phone lineup includes one LCD model -- the iPhone 11, which Apple launched at a starting price $50 lower than its predecessor -- and the company plans to add a second one in the first half of next year to replace the aging iPhone 8. But the Cupertino, California-based company may still shift entirely to OLED for new phones as early as 2020. Though it will still sell a number of older LCD models, the time for Japan Display is running out.After repeatedly pushing back mass production of its own OLED screens, JDI is finally close to having its first OLED product, Kikuoka said, declining to give further details other than to say that it wonât be a smartphone screen. A person familiar with the matter confirmed an earlier report that JDIâs first OLED will be used in the Apple Watch. Still, competing in the mobile phone arena would take billions of dollars in additional investment, money that Japan Display doesnât have.Apple Supplier JDI Plunges After Warning It May Not SurviveâThere was a time when we felt the need to rush a shift to OLED,â Kikuoka said. âWithout a partner who could pitch in on the capital side, we simply canât do it.âConstituted from the remains of numerous ailing Japanese display makers in 2012, JDI mistimed large investments in LCD capacity and found itself struggling against abler competition from South Korean and Chinese rivals. Five straight years of losses have sent it in search of a capital infusion from overseas, but the list of potential suitors has continued to dwindle. When Kikuoka took the helm in September, the company had just reached a new low, warning that if itâs not able to raise fresh capital it may face difficulties continuing its business.Japan Display said last month that it lost another potential investor as Chinaâs Harvest Tech Investment Management Co. withdrew from its rescue plan. That was the latest blow since June, when Cosgrove Global Ltd., Topnotch Corporate Ltd. and Taiwanâs TPK Holding Co. left a consortium that in April agreed to an infusion of 117 billion yen ($1.1 billion). JDI still expects to receive an investment from Oasis Management Co. and aims to raise a total of 50 billion yen by the end of the year. An unnamed customer that had previously been reported to be Apple may put in $200 million.Chinese screen makers BOE Technology Group Co. and Tianma Microelectronics Co. had also shown interest in JDIâs OLED technology, but both have since focused on developing their own versions. Having an actual track record of mass-producing OLED panels might bring those companies back to the table in the future, Kikuoka said. A joint venture at Japan Displayâs Hakusan plant in central Japan would be the easiest route, but exporting its manufacturing know-how to China is also an option, he said. JDI could furthermore be open to offers from private equity and other sources of financing.Kikuoka, 57, spent the first part of his career in finance with stints in Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Merrill Lynch. After more than a decade at electronics parts and materials suppliers Nitto Denko Corp. and Nidec Corp., he joined Japan Displayâs finance division in 2017. He was named chief financial officer in May before advancing to the top post last month.In August, Japan Display reported quarterly sales at the lowest level since the company went public in 2014, as demand from smartphone makers cratered with no prospects of recovery in the near future. The company has shed about 1,200 employees through a voluntary retirement plan, sold off some display manufacturing equipment and suspended production at one plant.Over-investing in factories at the peak of the demand cycle is only one of the causes for JDIâs current dire straits, according to Kikuoka. The company also fell victim to complacency because it was backed by Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a state-owned fund that remains JDIâs largest shareholder.âThat resulted in a culture that allowed losses to continue and a sense that someone would always come to our rescue,â he said. âWhat was missing was a real hunger to strive.â&#92;--With assistance from Mark Gurman.To contact the reporters on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.net;Yuki Furukawa in Tokyo at yfurukawa13@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-21,240.51,239.96,-0.55,-0.002286807,Don't move,13,40,1009,66,6.541129831516352

The hearing is titled âAn Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.ââWe fully expect politicians to use this forum as another major shot across the bow on broader antitrust concerns for FAANG names,â Ives said. He sees a regulatory and legal focus on Facebookâs WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, with âthe convergence of Facebookâs messaging platforms likely a hot button issue.âIves described Facebookâs Libra as a bid to âfurther penetrate its customer base with a financial currency that enables the company to become more entrenched in the purchasing cycle of its 2 billion-plus users.âOther tech companies are making similar efforts, he said, flagging Apple Inc.âs Apple Card with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and an âenhancedâ Apple Pay tool. On Tuesday, Goldman CEO David Solomon said the Apple credit card was the most successful card launch ever.Several payments companies left Facebookâs cryptocurrency project earlier this month. Analysts said the departures would likely delay the coinâs launch and shift Congressâs attention to other matters. That might give Zuckerberg some breathing room, they said.On Thursday, David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading Libra, said Chinaâs progress toward a digital payments system with global reach could pose a threat to U.S. influence. Marcus had earlier this month said that payments companies exiting Libra was in a way âliberating.âFacebookâs shares declined as much as 1.4% on Friday.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Debarati RoyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-18,236.41,240.51,4.1,0.017342752,Don't move,5,10,330,20,6.0606060606060606
179,429,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-more-facebook-revolutions-133350786.html?.tsrc=rss,There Will Be No More Facebook Revolutions,2019-10-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- âTwitter revolution,â âFacebook revolutionâ âÂ these terms became widespread during the Arab Spring rebellions at the beginning of this decade. Theyâre outdated now: For today's protesters in Hong Kong and Barcelona, or for Extinction Rebellion activists in capitals around the world, the social networks and even messenger applications run by big U.S. corporations are becoming a secondary tool, and one not used for organizational purposes.After protesters in Egypt forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign in February 2011, one of the revolutionâs public faces, Google executive Wael Ghonim, went on CNN to be interviewed by anchors Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer. When BlitzerÂ asked him what was going to happen next, the following exchangeÂ ensued:Ghonim: Ask Facebook.Blitzer: Ask what?Ghonim: Facebook.Cooper: Facebook.Blitzer: Facebook. Youâre giving Facebook a lot of credit for this?Ghonim: Yes, for sure. I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him, actually. This revolution started online. This revolution started on Facebook.That was so 2011. If thereâs any one app todayâs protesters would want to credit, itâs Telegram. But not even this itinerant messenger, whose team was based in St. Petersburg, Berlin, London and Singapore before ending up in Dubai, plays the same kind of outsize role that Facebook and Twitter took on in previous protests, up to and includingÂ Hong Kongâs Umbrella MovementâÂ of 2014.Â With its powerful group messaging functionality and âchannelâ feature which allows users to broadcast information, Telegram is the central media platform for the Hong Kong protesters of today, who are now pushing for greater democracy for the former British colony. Itâs also the go-to tool forÂ pro-independence Catalans who have taken to the streets to protest the long prison sentences for leaders of the Spanish regionâs doomed 2017 secession bid. There, the secretive Democratic Tsunami groupÂ uses Telegram to communicateÂ with its 150,000 followers. It also uses a Telegram bot to collect data for an app it created to map protest activities and street clashes.Â For its part, Extinction Rebellion has been moving from Facebook-owned WhatsApp to Telegram because it allows bigger group chats,Â and because it has a voting tool that allows independent-minded rebels to decide what they want to do. (This tool is also used in Hong Kong).Signal, the encrypted messenger, and Mattermost, an open-source alternative to the enterprise messenger Slack, also are popular among activists.Direct file transfers, encrypted messengers and specially created apps have become essential for spreading all kinds of material that might land its distributors in trouble âÂ such as the fake boarding passes Democratic Tsunami sent out soÂ protesters could get into the Barcelona airport on Oct. 14, causing more than 100 flights to be canceled.Of course, todayâs activists still use social media platforms run by big U.S. corporations. But when they do itâs mainly for outward communication such as with the media, not with people actively involved in the protests. Since the Arab Spring, governments have mastered use of the big commercial social mediaÂ networks themselves. Since the Hong Kong protests began,Â both Facebook and Twitter have complained about Chinaâs attempts to use them for disinformation and counterpropaganda. Besides, many protesters believe their anonymity isnât well protected on the social networks, Malek Dudakov of the Moscow-based think tank Center for the Study of New Communications wrote in a recent report about the use of the technology by the Hong Kong protest movement.Â Telegram, run by a nonprofitÂ founded by Russian libertarian Pavel Durov, has a reputation for resisting government attempts at censorship and infiltration. Russia has attempted to block the messenger for refusing to hand over encryption keys to domestic intelligence, but Telegram has fought back and is still accessible in most of Russia. Mainland China has had more success in cutting off access to it. But even on Telegram, the risk of losing oneâs anonymity is a potential problem. One protest group moderator in Hong Kong was arrested in June. Durov has accused China of trying to take his service down in Hong Kong with distributed denial of service attacks.Â Those efforts contrast with concerns that big U.S. companies are more likely to cooperate with the authorities.Earlier this month, Apple Inc. approved aÂ smartphone map app that Hong Kong protesters have been using for distribution in its App Store after an initial ban. But then it swiftly took HKmap.live down again. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook explained that the Hong Kong cybersecurity authority had told the company that the app was being used by criminals to âtarget individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.â This episode prompted the Democratic TsunamiÂ in Catalonia to release its own app for Android onlyÂ â and not through the Google Play Store, in which most Android users get their apps.Even though its services are blocked in mainland China, Google has also behaved in a way some protesters,Â and even some of its employees,Â find suspicious.Â Citing an internal rule against the monetization of current events, the Play Store banned a game called âThe Revolution of Our Timesâ that allowed players to act out the role of Hong Kong protesters.Â The gameâs developers had promised to give 80% of their proceeds to charity.Big Techâs role, even if unwitting, in unrest has always looked like an aberration. Where the profit motive is involved, cooperating with governments makes more sense than facilitating those who fight them. Now, the dust is settling on the tech revolution, and real-world revolutions need non-commercial tech tools. So protesters either design their own or fall back on open-source apps or those developed by nonprofits. Facebook and Twitter are where propaganda battles rage and insults fly, not where action is coordinated âÂ and thatâs a natural consequence of their evolution as big businesses that attract way too much government attention.So, if youâre wondering what comes next for all the modern-day protest movements, donât ask Facebook.To contact the author of this story: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion's Europe columnist.

The Taiwanese company also projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, an affirmation that the latest iPhones have proven a hit with consumers.Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei sketched out hopes that the emergence of 5G, the foundation of future technologies from automated factories and smart homes to blazing-fast consumer electronics, will help underpin its business in coming years. TSMC, which is the worldâs largest contract chipmaker, and is seen as a barometer for the tech industry thanks to its heft and place in the supply chain, said the advent of 5G-enabled smartphones will result in more chips in devices than before.âWe are much more optimistic than six months ago,â Wei said, adding that the 5G momentum was larger than the company expected. TSMC has increased its forecast of the 5G smartphone penetration rate in 2020 to a percentage in the mid-teens from its previous single-digit estimate. Many countries, especially larger ones, were rapidly pushing ahead with 5G rollout plans, Wei added.TSMC Puts All Its Chips on Capex. Thatâs a Smart Bet: Tim CulpanTSMCâs capital spending plan and outlook prompted price-target hikes from several analysts including at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Its shares, which notched a lifetime high just this month, stood largely unchanged Friday in Taipei. More broadly, suppliers including ASML Holding NV, Applied Materials Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. could stand to benefit from TSMCâs capex increase.In addition to 5G, TSMCâs push is driven by growing demand from tech giants such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co., said Roger Sheng, a semiconductor analyst with Gartner. Although the outlook remains uncertain for 2020, the global semiconductor market is set to make a gradual recovery on the back of the demand related to 5G, AI and automotive applications, according to a note from TrendForce on Oct. 2.âEveryone is waiting to see a bounce back of global smartphone market next year after Apple adopts 5G. The self-designed Huawei chipsets will also push demand, as will Qualcommâs 5nm chips for next year and AMDâs server chip demand,â Sheng said.On Thursday, TSMC also underlined expectations that Apple, its largest customer, is riding a bounce-back in demand for the iPhones after a lukewarm 2018 iteration. Lower prices and aging handsets are helping drive demand for the iPhone 11 range, and Apple is said to be asking its assemblers to target the high end of an original forecast for 70 million to 75 million unit shipments in 2019.Read more: Appleâs Lower Prices, Usersâ Aging Handsets Drive IPhone DemandThe Taiwanese company foresees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion in the pivotal December holiday quarter, surpassing an average projection for about $9.9 billion. TSMC gave that sales outlook after reporting net income of NT$101.1 billion ($3.3 billion) for the September quarter, handily beating estimates as the global chip market recovers.Still, fallout from ongoing trade conflicts could crimp an industry revival. While TSMC doesnât factor trade conflicts into its capex plans, any international trade war will have a negative effect on the semiconductor sector, Wei said. China is an especially important market for TSMC and the semiconductor industry, he added.TSMC and its industry peers had grappled with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs on No. 2 customer Huawei. But investors are growing more confident that the emergence of 5G will prop up chip prices and demand, while the latest iPhones are firing up consumers. TSMC is in fact straining against capacity constraints in the current quarter, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li said.The âiPhone is driving stronger near-term demand. We believe the competitive pricing of iPhone 11 is garnering good traction and has prompted Apple to place more orders at the supply chain,â Li said in an Oct. 10 note.Read more: Taiwanâs Market Fortunes Are Tied to TSMC Like Never Before(Updates with analystsâ hikes and shares from the fifth paragraph)To contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-18,236.41,240.51,4.1,0.017342752,Don't move,9,43,773,61,7.891332470892626

After all, software companies hold nothing physically tangible. They may have important intellectual property, but their value comes from the solutions and services their programs offer.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) are easy choices for investors who do not want to spend too much time understanding the software business. Yet holding IBM blindly is not without risk. The company reported revenue declining 4%.So, investors should consider other software companies that the market does not pay much attention to.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 7 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Investors should look at software stocks that have strong earnings growth prospects in the next year. If the stock is down from yearly highs or is on a downtrend, that is a bonus for investors looking for discounts. There are seven software stocks that investors should buy for growth. These firms offer unique solutions and therefore have moats. Software Stocks to Buy: DocuSign (DOCU)Source: Shutterstock DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) stumbled in August when the company issued a weak outlook. But when the company reported quarterly earnings on Sept. 5, it easily beat its downward guidance, sending the stock to 52-week highs. The company has a good chance of growing earnings per share by around 1.5 times and by 57% over the next five years. The stock is not cheap, trading at 13 times sales. DOCU has a market capitalization of around $11 billion.DocuSign transforms the foundation of doing business by moving customers from paper-based document signing to electronic signatures. It had 537,000 customers as of July 31. Fiscal year 2019 revenue grew 35% year-over-year and could grow even faster since its total addressable market is $25 billion. The company previously stumbled when it added more features to its core offering. This increased the time needed to close deals. Customers needed to spend more time reviewing the bundled features before deciding to buy the solution.DocuSign's view on the handling of today's paper agreement is that of a digital, connected, self-executing solution. Payment, customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems will handle all agreements in the future. With DocuSign unlocking the signing bottleneck, its customers complete deals more efficiently, saving everyone time. The firm has a web and mobile app with hundreds of millions of users. DocuSign is a rapidly-growing software firm with stock worth holding. Okta (OKTA)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) fell briefly below $100 in September. The company has a market cap of $12 billion. Analysts expect its EPS to grow 58% next year and 25% over the next five years. Piper Jaffray describes Okta as being in a class of its own after the company reported a good Q2/2020 earnings report. It lost 5 cents a share, though revenue grew 48.5% to $140.5 million. Okta enjoyed an exceptional quarter, lifted by subscription revenue growth of 51%, billings growth of 42% and remaining performance obligations growth of 68%. It added 450 new customers and now has 7,000.After a 46% growth in customers with an annual contract value above $100,000, Okta now has 1,200 customers in that category. With strong recurring revenue and an acceleration in customer acquisitions, the company may sustain earnings growth above the 25% annual baseline.In the last quarter, the company transitioned its offering from products to a component platform. That investment is paying off. It has a slew of new functionalities and products, such as Okta Advanced Server Access, that customers need. And since these features are still in their early phases, as customers buy more products from Okta, revenue growth will accelerate.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals If revenue grows faster than markets expect, this is a stock in the software sector that investors should buy for growth. ServiceNow (NOW)Source: Shutterstock For the last few months, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) traded in a tight trading range around $245-$270. When the company reports earnings next week, analysts expect the company to earn 88 cents a share on revenue of $885.8 million. Last quarter, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $781 million, up 33% year-over-year. The business was so robust that it increased its headcount to 9,382, up from 7,150 a year earlier. The company's results benefited from winning several large deals in the financial services, technology and automotive industry that involved multiple IT products.For full-year 2019, ServiceNow forecasts subscription billings between $3.74 billion and $3.75 billion, up 32% from last year. The most notable figures are its subscription gross margin expectations of 86% and its free cash flow margin of 28%.The company added more than 700 employees in Q2, so expect sales numbers to get a strong push. As the marketing department gets better at promoting ServiceNow and accounts get bigger, investors may confidently raise their long-term expectations.Customers find it easy to build on the ServiceNow platform, which is a clear strength of its business model. And because it is extensible, customers receive quick solutions. The company adds more technology through acquisitions, increasing the value of the platform. With this positive feedback loop, the company could reach a $10 billion revenue level in a few years. Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Best known for its iPhones, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stopped reporting unit sales last year. And for good reason. The company wants analysts to hone in on Apple's services. In the third quarter, Apple reported record revenue of $11.5 billion from services, up 13% year-over-year. AppleCare, music, cloud services and its app store search advertising business are all positive contributors to service revenue. Even though music and ad sales is not really &quot;software,&quot; it is becoming the biggest source of revenue for Apple.In the short term, investors will scrutinize Apple TV unit sales and subscription growth of its Apple TV+ offering. Yet investors may count on app sales, especially in China, for the next few years. EPS should grow 32.6% this year and 10% over the next five years. Solid sales of the iPhone 11 will lock in existing users to the Apple ecosystem. If Android users switch to an iPhone, that will help grow its services and software sales. AppleCare, Apple Music and cloud services are the three products more customers will willingly pay for. In the last quarter, services accounted for 21% of Apple's revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars. If it keeps growing, expect gross margin to increase due to scale.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now Credit card companies get to enjoy sky-high valuations but Apple Pay is growing at a healthy pace. It completed 1 billion transactions monthly, doubling the volume from last year. The service benefited from an Apple Pay launch in 17 countries in the June quarter. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com On Oct 16, Citi downgraded Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock from a &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral.&quot; Although the firm trimmed its price target slightly, the stock fell $10 on the day. The analysis is shortsighted: Adobe has virtually no competition and plenty of upside profit margin expansion ahead. Designers and media need Adobe's suite of products and have no other real alternatives. For the next quarter, analysts expect Adobe to report EPS of $1.86. The company beat expectations in the last three consecutive quarters, so expect another beat in the next report.In the last quarter, Adobe reported revenue of $2.8 billion, up 23.7% from last year. The record revenue is proof that its strategy to empower people to create and transform is paying off. Customers need to tell a story through design and creativity. So, they need Creative Cloud and Document Cloud software. Adobe reported net new digital media recurring revenue of $386 million. Total digital media ARR in Q3 topped $7.9 billion. The company has a goal of ensuring that Creative Cloud applications and services cover all its customers' creative needs. Adobe Lightroom and Document Cloud sales should continue its positive sales momentum.Adobe also saw strong growth for its single app offerings. Last quarter, apps like Adobe Premiere Pro for video and Adobe Illustrator contributed positively to the 40% year-over-year growth in international markets. Workday (WDAY)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) plunged by over 12% on Oct. 16 after the company's Rising event ended. Although RBC cut its target price on the stock that day, markets may have grown cautious over its new products. Investors may reasonably expect slow initial sales and are unwilling to value the company at around the $40 billion market cap level. Even though EPS growth will decelerate, falling 21% this year, its EPS should rebound by 31% next year and 28.5% over the next five years.In Q2, Workday said that over 40% of the Fortune 500 companies chose Workday for their core human capital management platform. As it expands globally, expect revenue growth to keep pace with historical rates. In the period, subscription revenue grew 34% to $757 million. Revenue outside of the U.S. rose 35% to $211 million and represented 24% of total revenue.The continued global expansion will offset any potential slowdown in the U.S. market. Workday also said it will recognize the subscription revenue backlog growth of 28%, or $4.8 billion, in the next 24 months.Workday warned that it faces tougher second-half comparable-store sales. Still, FY20 revenue will be near $3.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Q3 subscription revenue will grow 26% to between $783 million and $785 million.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy (With Brands You Can Find In Your Kitchen) WDAY stock peaked in July and is on a sustained downtrend.

And even though ADSK stock is trending lower, billings will grow 49%-51% to $4.1 billion. Next fiscal year, recurring revenue as a percentage of the total will be in the mid 90% range. Although revenue will fall in the second half of FY20, gross margins will rise, due to revenue growth for the year.Strong demand for AutoCAD LT and continued strength across all regions suggests sustainable growth beyond the fiscal year. Macro worries due to the ongoing trade war may hit the manufacturing sector but so far, Autodesk is immune to this risk.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Break up these giant companies that are dominating â big tech, big pharma, big oil. all of them.âStill, there were differences among them in approach. Andrew Yang said breaking up tech companies wonât revive main street businesses. Former Texas Representative Beto OâRourke said tech companies should be treated like publishers instead of like utilities. He criticized Warren for targeting specific companies, something he said President Donald Trump has done.âWe will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that,â he said. âBut I donât think itâs the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up.âHarris and OâRourke criticized social media companies for unevenly enforcing their rules for political content. Their comments came days after Warrenâs campaign bought Facebook ads claiming Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed President Donald Trump -- a falsehood quickly corrected in the ad itself but used to showcase that politicians can lie on the platform.Tech companies are facing rising bipartisan pressure throughout the U.S., and the Trump administration, Congress and even the states have quickly ramped up pressure on the companies, particularly on the question of whether they use their size to squelch competition.Alphabet Inc.âs Google faces antitrust probes by the Justice Department, and a separate investigation by a group of 51 attorneys general led by Texas who have demanded documents on the companyâs sprawling and lucrative digital ads business. The Federal Trade Commission is also speaking to third-party merchants who sell through Amazon, Bloomberg has reported.Both the FTC and Justice Department, which split antitrust jurisdiction, are also probing the technology sector general, as is a congressional committee led by Democratic Representative David Cicilline that issued extensive document requests to Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple Inc. in September.After years of hands-off approach by policy-makers, Washingtonâs concerns have followed a swift decrease in the publicâs positive attitudes toward big tech. Just 50% of U.S. adults said technology companies have a positive impact on the country, down from 71% in four years earlier, according to Pew Research Center survey results released July 29. Pew has previously found that a majority of Americans think tech wields too much power.&#92;--With assistance from Ben Brody.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-16,234.37,235.28,0.91,0.0038827490000000004,Don't move,1,5,590,7,1.1864406779661016

It also reported that 50% of all iPhones are on iOS 13, while 33% of iPads are on iOS 13. Some older iPhones and iPads are no longer supported by the latest software.The four-year metric is important because thatâs typically when people upgrade to new iPhones. Once people stop receiving new software updates, theyâre more likely to buy a new handset from Apple.Apple likes to tout upgrade numbers in comparison to Google, which sees much slower adoption when it updates its Android operating system. iOS 13 added features like Dark Mode and a new Find My app to the iPhone, while the iPad gained a better web browser, file management app, and an updated Home screen.Despite users quickly upgrading to the new software, some consumers have been complaining about bugs. Apple has already released four updates to iOS 13 since the initial release on Sept. 19. Another update, iOS 13.2, is already in beta testing with developers. iOS 13.2 adds the ability to opt out of Siri recordings and switch between video recording resolutions on the iPhone 11 within the camera app.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-15,235.32,234.37,-0.95,-0.004037056,Don't move,4,3,259,11,4.247104247104247

205,501,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-results-test-investors-mettle-175732918.html?.tsrc=rss,Netflix Results Will Test Investorsâ Mettle as Competition Looms,2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The stakes are often high when Netflix Inc. reports results: Stock swings of 10% or more arenât uncommon. But with the shares down more than a fifth since the streaming giant disappointed investors in July, the risk of another plunge may be lower this time around.When Netflix posts results after markets close Wednesday, analysts expect an increase of about 800,000 U.S. subscribers for the third quarter and about 6 million internationally. Whether or not the company hits those targets may depend on how much Netflixâs new programming resonated with viewers.The timing of Netflixâs latest shows probably helped subscriber growth, said Third Bridgeâs Scott Kessler, who cited the new season of âStranger Thingsâ as a potential driver. Netflix also may have gotten a boost from a competitorâs show, HBOâs âGame of Thrones,â ending its run.Gerber Kawasaki Inc., a Netflix investor, also expects âa pop from the people moving from HBO and resubscribing,â thanks to âStranger Things.âStill, Gerber investment adviser Nick Licouris said the firm has been reducing its position because of looming competition from Apple Inc., Walt Disney Co., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. The Santa Monica, California-based wealth manager holds more than 12,000 shares valued at almost $3.7 million, according to a June regulatory filing.The earnings report this afternoon âis a heavily debated setup, the trickiest one in a while,â said Lynx Equity analysts KC Rajkumar and Jahanara Nissar. The firm called it âa high-wire actâ where âmuch could go wrong.âGiven that Netflix has been growing so much faster internationally, analysts will be eyeing the companyâs progress -- and spending -- in key foreign markets.âWeâre looking to see if thereâs any meaningful traction with some of the lower-priced, mobile-only plans -- with India primarily,â Andy Hargreaves, a KeyBanc Capital analyst, said in an interview.Netflix itself predicted in July it would add a total of 7 million subscribers in the third quarter -- 800,000 in the U.S. and 6.2 million elsewhere.Read more: Netflix Investors Are Bracing for Another Disappointing QuarterMany investors may still be smarting from the companyâs last quarterly report. Three months ago, Netflix posted disappointing second-quarter subscriber growth -- and a rare drop in the U.S. The shares slumped 10%.âIt would be hard for it to be worseâ this time, Hargreaves said, though investor concerns will persist as new streaming services increase the risk of higher subscriber churn or marketing costs, according to a note.Rosenblatt Securities predicts the companyâs fourth-quarter subscriber guidance will miss Wall Streetâs consensus, according to a note from analyst Bernie McTernan. He expects the forecast to âbe treated with greater than normal skepticismâ given that Netflix is reporting weeks before the launch of competing offerings, such as Disney+.âNetflix has never faced this level of competition from a new entrant,â he wrote.And although Netflix remains the largest short in the film and entertainment sector, âshort sellers have been slowly trimming their exposure,â according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The streaming serviceâs short interest totals $6.2 billion with almost 22 million shares shorted and about 1.8 million shares covered since the beginning of August, the firm said.Gerberâs Licouris sees room for both a Netflix and Disney+, but warns that âat some point, it becomes extremely saturated.âOn Tuesday, for example, the largest U.S. theater chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., announced a new service that would give U.S. subscribers online access to nearly 2,000 movies for rent or purchase.See also: Netflix Earnings-Linked Options Lean Bullish in Run-Up to ReportWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Netflix will not only have to exceed its guidance for 7 million subscriber additions but also deliver a healthy 4Q forecast to allay concerns that have dogged the company.-- Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst-- Click here for the researchJust the Numbers3Q streaming paid net change estimate (Bloomberg MODL)3Q domestic +798,3603Q international +6 million3Q revenue estimate $5.25 billion (Bloomberg data)3Q GAAP EPS estimate $1.05 (range $1 to $1.23)4Q streaming paid net change estimate (Bloomberg MODL)4Q domestic +1.28 million4Q international +8.04 million4Q revenue estimate $5.51 billion (range $5.40 billion to $5.70 billion)4Q GAAP EPS estimate 82c (range 44c to $1.12)Data31 buys, 10 holds, 4 sells; avg.

206,518,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elizabeth-warren-vows-first-nominee-140000156.html?.tsrc=rss,Elizabeth Warren Vows to Be First Nominee to Forgo High-Dollar Fundraisers,2019-10-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren pledged Tuesday to forgo any high-dollar fundraising events if she becomes the Democratic nominee, a move that would make her the first general-election candidate to do so and could be a high-stakes gamble against a cash-rich incumbent and a well-funded GOP apparatus.But Warren would still accept high-dollar contributions from most people who choose to write her a check without getting special access or seeing her in person. She also vowed to refuse to accept âany contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds.âWarrenâs pledge also wouldnât stop the party or super-PACs from raising vast amounts of money on her behalf. But it may stop wealthy donors from cutting big checks if they believe it wonât help them get access to the nominee.âWhen Iâm the Democratic nominee for president, Iâm not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PACs. No federal lobbyists. No special access or call time with rich donors or big dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign,â Warren said in a statement released by her campaign.Still, some Democrats fear it would put the party at a huge fundraising disadvantage against President Donald Trump, whoâs raking in vast sums of money from big donors by his own campaign and by super-PACs that support him.Rufus Gifford, the finance director for former President Barack Obamaâs 2012 campaign, has said Warrenâs earlier suggestions to avoid high-dollar events was âa colossally stupid decisionâ that would cost Democrats not only in the presidential contest but also in down-ballot races.But it also reflects her populist pitch to be a different kind of candidate who isnât corrupted by special interest money, and so far she has proven adept at generating small-dollar contributions that are envied by her party rivals.A Warren campaign aide said the decision to accept no more than $200 from executives and big tech or financial firms was âretroactiveâ and any contributions above $200 from those people would be returned.The aide also said that big tech companies under this guideline will include Alphabet Inc., which is Googleâs parent company; Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.Nominees traditionally complain about the amount of time needed to raise money in a campaign and call for changes in financing presidential races, but then say they canât âunilaterally disarmâ against a well-funded opponent.Warrenâs bet is that her pitch will propel her campaign in the Democratic contest -- where sheâs tied with Joe Biden for the top spot -- and mobilize many of the estimated 100 million eligible voters who didnât turn out in the 2016 election. Biden spends a significant amount of time raising money from traditional donor bases.Itâs unclear how Warrenâs pledge would apply to the Democratic National Committee, which can accept contributions from individuals of as much as $355,000 for various accounts, including $35,500 per donor that can be used to influence the election.And it wouldnât apply to outside groups like super-PACs, which under federal law cannot coordinate their activities with campaigns. In 2016, Priorities USA had more than 30 individual donors who contributed more than $1 million.Obama barred contributions from registered lobbyists and corporate PACs. The DNC was outraised by its Republican counterpart in 2012 by almost $100 million, yet Obama, a popular incumbent, won overwhelmingly against rival Mitt Romney in the election. The party lifted the bans in 2016, and the DNC raised $354 million compared to $343 million for the Republican National Committee.Warren often highlights her approach to fundraising on the campaign trail, reassuring prospective voters that her campaign is fueled by them, not big dollar donors.âI donât spend my time at fundraisers for bazilionaires and corporate executives,â Warren said during a town hall in Austin, Texas, last month. âI just donât do it.âWhen asked whether her grassroots fundraising model could leave her without enough money to go against Trump in the general election, Warren was adamant that a flurry of contributions between $5 and $25 would be enough. Trump and the RNC raised $125 million in the first quarter, more than all of the major Democrats combined.âIf you think itâs going to be all about scooping up a bunch of money from rich people, and then buying a bunch of TV ads, and thatâs how it is someoneâs gonna win, then, yeah, it looks like Trumpâs doing a lot here,â Warren said recently in San Diego. âI just donât think thatâs how democracy works anymore. And I sure donât think thatâs how itâs going to work in 2020. I think itâs going to be about getting out and building a grassroots movement.âIn his battle against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Bernie Sanders relied primarily on small-dollar donors to raise $235.4 million through the end of May 2016, nearly matching the $238.2 million she raised over the same period.But Clinton also had joint fundraising committees that raised millions for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.Trump is using the same arrangements to build a huge financial advantage over his rivals. His campaign and the RNC, plus a pair of joint fundraising committees that raise money for each, have taken more than $300 million through this year, according to Federal Election Commission reports and totals announced by Trumpâs re-election effort.Warren has raised $60.2 million in the same period, including about $10 million she transferred from her Senate campaign.(Updates with Warren aide saying big tech donation policy was retroactive in eighth, ninth paragraphs.)To contact the reporters on this story: Sahil Kapur in Washington at skapur39@bloomberg.net;Bill Allison in Washington at ballison14@bloomberg.net;Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou in Washington at megkolfopoul@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Max BerleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-14,235.87,235.32,-0.55,-0.002331793,Don't move,2,15,957,19,1.9853709508881923

Concerns around those tariffs have resulted in a 10% to 15% discount on U.S. technology stocks by his estimation and the removal could âunleash a ârisk onâ scenarioâ into year-end.Technology stocks had rallied throughout Fridayâs session on speculation that some form of trade agreement was near. The shares pared some of those gains as investors realized that several of the thorniest issues, including those related to Huawei Technologies Co., remain unresolved. Huawei, which was blacklisted earlier this year, is a major buyer of U.S. electronic components.The late pullback wasnât enough to prevent Apple Inc. from closing at a record and overtaking Microsoft Corp. as the worldâs most valuable company. Greater China accounted for about 17% of Appleâs revenue in the fiscal third quarter and is home to a key portion of its supply chain.

The move made Apple the most-valuable U.S. company again, topping Microsoft Corp. Both have a market value of more than $1 trillion. Earlier, the U.S. and China agreed on the outlines of a partial trade accord.The record is the culmination of a pronounced rally throughout 2019, a year that started on a highly bearish note, as Apple cut its revenue outlook for the first time in nearly 20 years. That move, taken in response to a weak outlook for iPhones upgrades and Chinaâs economy, took the stock to its lowest level since April 2017.Since then, however, shares have been on a nearly uninterrupted march higher, with the stock higher in seven of the past nine months, not including Octoberâs month-to-date gain of about 4%. Apple has climbed more than 60% off its January low, returning its valuation back above $1 trillion.Just as Appleâs weakness in the fourth quarter of 2018 was largely driven by concern over iPhone demand, the 2019 recovery has come on an easing of those fears. CEO Tim Cook recently told the German newspaper Bild that he âcouldnât be happierâ with the launch of Appleâs recently released iPhone 11, and it was reported in early October that Apple had told suppliers to increase production. Analysts, in turn, have been growing more positive on demand, while also anticipating that next yearâs model -- expected to be the first 5G version -- will be a blockbuster.In other respects, Apple is a different company from when it was last trading at all-time highs a year ago. The Cupertino, California-based firm is reinventing itself as a services-based company, with such initiatives as streaming video, video games and a credit card. In another change, the historically high-end gadget-maker unveiled these new businesses and products at less-aggressive prices.Despite the new-found focus on services, the iPhone continues to be Appleâs keystone product. Nearly half of its third-quarter revenue came from the product, compared with the 21.3% that was derived from services.Apple is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Oct. 30. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.84 a share on revenue of $62.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That represents a decline of 2.6% for earnings and flat sales growth.According to a Bloomberg MODL estimate, it will ship 41.9 million iPhones in the quarter, at an average selling price of $770.35. That would represent a year-over-year drop of 14.5% for shipments, and a 3.1% decline in average price.(Updates with closing shares in the second paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Brad OlesenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-10,230.09,236.21,6.12,0.026598287999999998,Buy,12,35,514,59,11.478599221789883

And in theory, theyâre letting people limit what data is collected or how the companies harness that information to target ads or improve their computerized systems.This is all great, in theory. In practice, of course, transparency and control can be less than they seem. And even in principle, it sometimes misses the point. What if, in addition to transparency and control, internet companies deploy this sophisticated technology called âcommon senseâÂ when theyâre building and spreading their products?For example, when Facebook got caught using phone numbers that people entered for account security to target ads, the company (belatedly) said it should have told users what it was doing.âWeâll either have more disclosures and be very transparent about it, or we will no longer utilize it for ads,âÂ Facebook executive Carolyn EversonÂ told an interviewer last year. Twitter on Tuesday also disclosed it may have targeted adsÂ based on the information people entered to keep their accounts secure. Twitter said this was an error, although the company didnât say how long this practice had gone on.For Facebook, the choice Everson sketched out was moot in the end. As part of aÂ recent Federal Trade Commission settlementÂ of an investigation intoÂ user privacy violations, Facebook committed to not using account-safeguard information for advertising.Â The broader point lives on. Was the problem that Facebook (and Twitter) didnât disclose this activity? Yes. The other problem is that the companies were using personal information in ways that people should not and could not reasonably expect.Most people wouldnât think that entering a phone number into their account for security purposes might be used for advertising. Thatâs a good signal that companies shouldnât do it in the first place.Ditto for the recent reporting about Facebook and other companies having humans transcribe text from usersâÂ audio snippets. Yes, it was wrong that Facebook didnâtÂ tell people who turned on an audio transcription feature in Messenger that humans might be listening to portionsÂ of their chats.Dave Limp, the Amazon.com Inc.Â executive overseeing Alexa-powered devices, told tech news publication GeekWire on Wednesday that he wishes his company had been more transparentÂ about the human reviewers of Alexa audio recordings. Hours later, Bloomberg News reported that Amazon workers review select video clips captured by the companyâs Cloud Cam home security cameras.Amazon does not explicitly tell people who own a Cloud Cam that humans are reviewing theirÂ video snippets to improve the deviceâs motion-detection software. Amazon said the video clips are provided voluntarily, but two sources told Bloomberg that the video review teams have picked up private activity of homeowners, including rare instances of people having sex.Â Limp said at the GeekWire conference that Amazon considered allowing human review of audio clips from Alexa-powered devices only if the device owners explicitly agreed to it. Ultimately, he said, Amazon decided that human review is essential to improve the Alexa technology and said Amazon wants to use peopleâs data to improve technology for the companyâs customers. Amazon, in short, has unilaterally decided that whatâs best for people is to be poorly informed guinea pigs to improve an Amazon technology.Â And regardless of what Facebook, Amazon, Twitter or other companies do or donât disclose in the fine print, do people using audio transcription, motion detection video cameras and voice-activated assistants like Alexa and Apple Inc.âs Siri expect humans to listen to snippets of their conversationsÂ or watch clips of video filmed inside their homes? Of course not.People might intuitively understand their voice recordings are stowed in a company database somewhere, but common sense should tell those companies not to do things people would not anticipate.Companies shouldnât just rely on disclosure or measures of control as a cure-all for aggressive use of peopleâs personal information. Yes, by all means companies shouldnât use data without giving people an informed choice, but companies also shouldnât do stuff in the first place that people wouldnât expect. If Siri or Alexa stay a littleÂ dumb becauseÂ they canât harness peopleâs voice clips and home video to train them, so be it.Â A version of this column originally appeared in Bloombergâs Fully Charged technology newsletter.

The oil giant will gauge market conditions and assess feedback from a roadshow for potential cornerstone investors that ends this week before giving the final go ahead, the people said.Aramco is speeding up preparations for the IPO with an aim of listing on the Saudi bourse as soon as November, Bloomberg News has reported. People involved in the deal say about 2% of Aramco may be sold, which could raise $40 billion. The firm is targeting a valuation of at least $2 trillion -- more than double that of Apple Inc. The sale is key to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmanâs strategy to fund the diversification of the OPEC nationâs economy.Upcoming key dates:Note: Dates subject to change and according to people familiar with the matterInvestment banksâ research teams are in the midst of preparing pre-IPO reports on Aramco, according to an internal schedule seen by Bloomberg. Analysts had barely three weeks to get them done, compared with six-to-eight weeks they normally get for some of the biggest global listings.Each bankâs team needed to finish a first draft of their analysis by Oct. 9, with second drafts due Oct. 15. The reports need to be finalized and printed by Oct. 18, so they can be ready to be distributed to fund managers once Aramco announces its intention to float on Oct. 20, the schedule shows.While Aramco is likely to move ahead with the listing, no final decision has been made and the Saudis could still decide to delay or cancel the IPO, the people said.

A new proposal developed at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank backed by industrial-country governments, is a big step forward.Under existing rules, multinationals have great leeway to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, with little regard to where their products are actually produced or consumed. This so-called base-erosion problem is only going to get worse. The long-term move from manufacturing to services, and from physical to intangible assets, keeps widening the opportunities for avoidance. Governments are already losing about $500 billion a year as a result â a revenue shortfall that has to be made good by taxing workers, and companies without international operations, more heavily.Taxing multinationals in part according to the location of their customers would make such avoidance harder, because customers arenât as mobile as a titular corporate headquarters. Essentially, thatâs what the OECD is advocating. The details, including exactly how to divide the revenue, need to be hammered out â but merely accepting the basic principle would be valuable progress.One notable advantage of this approach: It doesnât target a single industry, as countries such as France have done. Technology giants such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. would be affected, but no more than other multinationals of similar size. The idea would encompass any company with at least $800 million in annual revenue and a significant customer base in foreign markets. It would apply only to a share of profits above an agreed threshold. This also makes sense, because it would make the system easier to operate, and soften political resistance to the change.Critics say the proposal doesnât go far enough, leaving profits undertaxed and benefiting rich countries more than poor. They have a point: Possible alternatives are more ambitious. Nonetheless, giving weight to customersâ location is a big improvement when it comes to narrowing the opportunities for avoidance. And a failure to adopt some such cooperative principles would lead more governments to follow Franceâs example and impose new taxes on foreign multinationals â unilaterally, inequitably and inefficiently. Austria, Italy and the U.K. are considering similar plans.France and others have said theyâll stand down if discussions at the OECD come up with a solution. Now they have â in outline, at least. Officials have been tasked to produce a final plan next year. Finance ministers are arriving in Washington for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. They should take the opportunity to endorse this tax-rule proposal and press to complete the plan. Theyâll be showing, into the bargain, that global economic cooperation is not quite yet a lost cause.&#92;--Editors: Alexis Leondis, Clive Crook.To contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinionâs editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .Editorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-10,230.09,236.21,6.12,0.026598287999999998,Buy,1,22,489,24,4.9079754601226995

Those video snippets are then used to train the AI algorithms to do a better job distinguishing between a real threat (a home invader) and a false alarm (the cat jumping on the sofa).An Amazon team also transcribes and annotates commands recorded in customersâ homes by the companyâs Alexa digital assistant, BloombergÂ reportedÂ in April.AI has made it possible to talk to your phone. Itâs helping investorsÂ predict shifts in market sentiment. But the technology is far from infallible. Cloud Cam sends out alerts when itâs just paper rustling in a breeze. Apple Inc.âs Siri and Amazonâs Alexa still occasionally mishear commands. One day, engineers may overcome these shortfalls, but for now AI needs human assistance. Lots of it.At one point, on a typical day, some Amazon auditors were each annotatingÂ about 150 video recordings, which were typically 20 to 30 seconds long, according to the people, who requested anonymity to talk about an internal program.The clips sent for review come from employee testers, an Amazon spokeswoman said, as well as Cloud Cam owners who submit clips to troubleshoot such issues as inaccurate notifications and video quality.Â âWe take privacy seriously and put Cloud Cam customers in control of their video clips,â she said, adding that unless the footage is submitted for troubleshooting purposes, âonly customers can view their clips.âNowhere in the Cloud Cam user terms and conditions does Amazon explicitly tell customers that human beings are training the algorithms behind their motion detection software.And despite Amazonâs insistence that all the clips are provided voluntarily, according to two of the people, the teams have picked up activity homeowners are unlikely to want shared, including rare instances of people having sex.Clips containing inappropriate content are flagged as such, then discarded so they arenât accidentally used to train the AI, the people said. Amazon's spokeswoman said such clips are scrapped to improve the experience of the company's human reviewers, but she didn't say why unsuitable activity would appear in voluntarily submitted video clips.The workers said Amazon has imposed tight security on the Cloud Cam annotation operation. In India, dozens of reviewers work on a restricted floor, where employees arenât allowed to use their mobile phones, according to two of the people. But that hasnât stopped other employees from passing footage to non-team members, another person said.Â The Cloud Cam debuted in 2017 and, along with the Alexa-powered line of Echo speakers, is one of several gadgets Amazon hopes will give it an edge in the emerging smart-home market.The $120 device detects and alerts people to activity going on in their homes and offers them free access to the footage for 24 hours. Users willing to pay about $7Â to $20 for a monthly subscription can extend that access for as long as one month and receive tailored alertsâfor a crying baby, say, or a smoke alarm. Amazon doesnât reveal how many Cloud Cams it sells, but the device is just one of many home security cams on the market, from Googleâs Nest to Amazon-owned Ring.While AI algorithms are getting better at teaching themselves, Amazonâlike many companiesâdeploys human trainers across its businesses; they help Alexa understand voice commands, teach the companyâs automated Amazon Go convenience stores to distinguish one shopper from another and are even working on experimental voice software designed to detect human emotions.Using humans to train the artificial intelligence inside consumer products is controversial among privacy advocates because of concerns its use can expose personal information. The revelation that an Amazon team listens to Alexa voice commandsÂ and subsequent disclosures about similar review programs at Google and Apple prompted attention from European and American regulators and lawmakers. The uproar evenÂ spurred some Echo owners to unplug their devices.Amid the backlash, both Apple and Google paused their own human review programs. For its part, Amazon began letting Alexa users exclude their voice recordings from manual review and changed its privacy policies to include an explanation thatÂ humans may listen to their recordings.Reports by the Information and the Intercept technology websites in the last year examined the human role in training the software behind security cameras built byÂ Ring. The sites reported that employees used clips customersÂ had shared through a Ring app to train computer vision algorithms, and, in some cases, shared unencrypted customer videos with each other.Amazon doesnât tell customers much about its troubleshooting process for Cloud Cam. In its terms and conditions, the company reserves the right to process images, audio and video captured by devices to improve its products and services.In a Q&A about Cloud Cam on its website, Amazon says âonly you or people you have shared your account information with can view your clips, unless you choose to submit a clip to us directly for troubleshooting.

On Wednesday morning, the song was not available in China and Hong Kongâs iTunes stores.âOver and over again, Appleâs actions are incomprehensible, and people have to wonder about their intentions,â the Peopleâs Daily article said. âThis reckless behavior will cause a lot of trouble for Apple, and it needs to think deeply,â it said, adding that allowing the âpoisonousâ software to gain traction is âa betrayal of Chinese peopleâs feelings.âApple joins other foreign companies struggling to navigate the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong as protests that began in June show no sign of abating. The issue has become a red line for those doing business in China, most recently drawing the National Basketball Association into a firestorm over a tweet thatâs caused partners to stop doing business with the NBA and state television to halt airing its games.Apple also removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from some iPhones, underscoring the difficult balance the company must strike in supporting free speech while appeasing China. The change was implemented via software on iPhones sold in Hong Kong and Macau after Apple released new versions of its iOS 13 operating system.&#92;--With assistance from Dominic Lau.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Kelly Li in Shanghai at kli82@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, Sharon Chen, Charlie ZhuFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-09,227.03,230.09,3.06,0.013478395,Don't move,2,6,334,10,2.9940119760479043

The new gaming console will sport a controller equipped with improved physical feedback technology to convey a variety of sensations, and can also adjust the resistance of triggers to mimic the sensation of drawing a bow or revving an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain.Sony has sold more than 100 million units of the PlayStation 4 as of June and aims to move almost 12 million more by March 2020. Itâs on track to become the companyâs best-selling console after the PS2, of which Sony has sold more than 155 million units. But the next iteration of the device may also be the last, as faster internet speeds are making it possible to play games on remote servers without a local device.In the 25 years since the original PlayStation debuted, games have grown in importance for Sony while its once-famed Walkman, Xperia and Bravia brands waned. To ensure the business survives the transition to cloud gaming, Sony has partnered with Microsoft Corp. This month, it cut the price of its PlayStation Now video game service in half, to $9.99 a month, reflecting increasing competition in online offerings. Apple Inc. introduced its Arcade service in September at a monthly price of $4.99 and Google has a $9.99-a-month Stadia product.To contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-09,227.03,230.09,3.06,0.013478395,Don't move,6,8,302,20,6.622516556291391

Sign up here.Â Two American consumer electronics companies said this week that theyâre looking to shift manufacturing away from China and into other countries, citing pressures from import tariffs on their products amid the trade war.Fitbit Inc. said on Wednesday that it would stop Chinese manufacturing of its health trackers and smartwatches by January. Tile Inc. said itâs also considering plans to makeÂ its Bluetooth-enabled location trackers in other countries, after the company was hit with tariffs last month.âThe biggest challenge for a company like Tile is our ability to plan for shifting changes in U.S. policy toward China,â said Chief Executive Officer CJ Prober. âWith recent impacts, we are looking at other regions.âTileÂ on Tuesday added a new sticker to its lineup of tracking devices that help customers keep tabs on keys, wallets and the like, and raised $45 million in funding in its last round of funding earlier this year. The gadget maker does the majority of its manufacturing in China, but as the U.S.-China trade war has escalated, itâsÂ now consideringÂ Mexico, Malaysia, Vietnam and âpossibly the U.S.â as future manufacturing hubs, Prober said.âWe are re-evaluating our entire supply chain and how we do what and where,â he said, adding that in recent weeks, TileÂ had dedicated an âentire teamâ to the task of traveling to different cities and evaluating manufacturing facilities. In a sign of concern from investors about the potential costs of relocating these operations, shares of San Francisco-based Fitbit fell as much as 2% Wednesday after announcing the move from China.Several U.S. companies, long accustomed to using China as a manufacturing base, are now looking to reduce their exposure to the country. Last year, GoPro Inc. announced it would move much of itsÂ U.S.-bound camera production out of China to avoid potential tariffs, and has largely accomplished thatÂ goal, according to aÂ spokesman. In August, HP Inc.âs laptop maker Inventec Corp. said it will shift production of notebooks for the U.S. market away from China. Apple Inc. has been doing battle with the White House over requests to get the iPhone and other products off the list of Chinese-made goods slated to be hit with tariffs on Dec. 15.The latest $300 billion round of duties will impactÂ essentially all remaining Chinese importsâwith some exceptions, though details around which imports will be exempted are still unclear. Trade policy between the worldâs two largest economies is still in flux.Â Chinese Vice PremierÂ Liu HeÂ is set to visit the U.S.Â this weekÂ for further trade talks.âWe are supportive of the overall policyâ of the U.S. in its negotiations with China, Tileâs Prober said. But âwhatâs been challenging is the implementation of that policy.â The company âonly got a few weeksâ noticeâ that its products would be subject to new tariffs before they went into effect in September, he said.Â (Updates with Fitbit news in the second paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Candy Cheng in San Francisco at ccheng86@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-08,224.4,227.03,2.63,0.011720143,Don't move,3,23,519,29,5.5876685934489405

Still, that is a profit decline of more than 50% for the Suwon, South Korea-based company.Samsung, the worldâs largest producer of mobile phones and smartphone displays, is benefiting from solid demand for its Note 10 and for Apple Inc.âs iPhone 11 Pro, which uses the companyâs OLED displays. Yet, the memory chip business has been its most profitable and uncertainties there have lingered because of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and Japanese restrictions on the export of materials essential for chip and display production.âItâs better-than-expected results as mobile business made a huge improvement,â said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.Shares rose as much as 1.4% and had climbed 23% this year through Mondayâs close.Sales for the third quarter were 62 trillion won, beating the average projection compiled by Bloomberg of 61.14 trillion won. Samsung wonât provide net income or break out divisional performance until it releases final results later this month.Samsungâs new high-end smartphones, including the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Fold, helped cushion profit declines in the memory business. Its display business is recovering from a slump, with strong demand for OLED displays for smartphones such as Appleâs iPhone 11.The volatile business environment due to the U.S.-China trade war and South Korea-Japan spat has fueled uncertainties and made it harder for the market to gauge demand. As Japanâs export curbs on key materials used in chips and display production kicked in early July, clients raised their inventories of memory components to minimize risk, according to a note from TrendForce on Sept 26.âThe stock-up demand was stronger than expected this third quarter due to the seasonal tailwinds and the pulling forward of end product shipments ahead of a possible new round of U.S. tariff increases in December,â said TrendForce. âConsequently, the overall trend of contract prices also shifted from decline to stability during the third quarter.âAnalysts raised operating profit estimates in recent weeks as dynamic random-access memory shipments improved in the third quarter. Citi estimated Samsung would report semiconductor profits slightly higher than its previous estimates, supported by a 30% increase in DRAM shipments quarter-on-quarter, despite a 20% drop in DRAM prices.Concerns over the impact on the production of chips and displays have eased among some market watchers as Japan approved shipments of key materials to Samsung. Liquid hydrogen fluoride -- a highly purified chemical used to refine chips in production -- has not been approved for shipment to South Korea so far, but multiple reports and analysts indicate a local supplier may be able to provide substitutes.âAlthough DRAM and NAND demand is recovering and shipments in the third quarter were quite robust, there is skepticism about the sustainability of the demand upturn,â said Sanjeev Rana, technology analyst at CLSA.With the trade war issues hanging over the tech industry, Micron Technology Inc. warned that the tensions may prolong a memory-chip industry slump and gave a disappointing profit forecast. Despite the cautious outlook, investors are growing more bullish on Samsung amid hopes for an end to the slide.âAs inventory de-stocking cycles end at major customers, we expect the memory industry to enter a recovery stage in 2020, while the magnitude of recovery will be more gradual (especially for DRAM) relative to previous upturn cycles,â J.P. Morgan said in an Oct 3 note.In the third quarter, contract prices for 32-gigabyte DRAM server modules fell 13.8% compared to the previous quarter while those for 128 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips rose 12.3%, according to inSpectrum Tech Inc.(Updates with analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sohee Kim in Seoul at skim847@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-08,224.4,227.03,2.63,0.011720143,Don't move,8,59,671,75,11.177347242921014

After Apple released new versions of its iOS 13 operating system in recent days, users in those cities noticed that the Taiwanese flag option was no longer available on the emoji keyboard. Local websites, including Hiraku in Taiwan, reported the move earlier.Apple previously removed the Taiwanese flag emoji for users in mainland China. Users in other regions are able to remove the flag by setting their iPhonesâ local country to Hong Kong or Macau. If a person sends the flag to a user in those areas, it will still appear. Thatâs not possible on mainland China iPhones. An Apple spokesman didnât respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Although China and Taiwan have been governed separately for decades, the Communist Party maintains unification as its ultimate goal. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence, has stepped up her criticism of Beijing as democracy protests in Hong Kong fuel new skepticism about unification.Apple sells millions of iPhones in China and it relies on huge Chinese factories to assemble most of its handsets. But the company must also follow local laws that have become increasingly tough when it comes to digital information. Last week, Apple rejected and then approved a maps app that shows hot spots in the Hong Kong protests.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-07,227.06,224.4,-2.66,-0.011714965,Don't move,4,2,291,10,3.436426116838488

The judge added more damages, royalties and interest to bring the final judgment to $506 million. That figure would have gone higher if the appeals court had upheld the verdict.Apple, in urging the Supreme Court to deny the foundationâs appeal, argued that the Federal Circuit used settled law to decide that âno reasonable juror could have foundâ infringement in the case.The microprocessor technology involved in the case provides a way for computer processors to execute instructions. The foundation claimed that Appleâs A7, A8 and A8X chips in the iPhone 5s and iPad infringed its patent. A second case, which is pending, targets newer Apple processors.The case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc., 18-1508.To contact the reporter on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Laurie AssÃ©oFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-07,227.06,224.4,-2.66,-0.011714965,Don't move,6,3,292,15,5.136986301369863

The prospect of a transaction being rekindled in the near term looks bleak â though not impossible over the longer run. It beggars belief that a tense round of bidding can culminate in no more than a tangled mess. But this is regrettably often the way with GermanÂ M&A.AMS, which makes sensors and supplies Apple Inc.,Â made a tactical error last week by raising its offer to 4Â billion euros ($4.4 billion) from 3.7Â billion euros to pre-empt a possible counter-bid from Bain and fellow private equity firm Advent International. It had already lowered the acceptance threshold (the level of shareholder support it would require before pushing ahead with the deal) to just 63% of Osramâs shares. Yet its sweetener sowed confusion. Retail shareholders didnât tender to its supposed knockout offer in big enough numbers.Meanwhile, some of OsramâsÂ hedge fund investors probably withheld their support, believing that they could squeeze more money later from AMS for their own sharesÂ â a gambit that has backfired for now.Osram shareholders currently have no deal at all and the path to a transaction is long and winding. By default, AMS canât rebid quickly without the assent of both Osram and Germanyâs financial regulators. It would have to demonstrate that any fresh offer would have a better chance of succeeding. That would mean sweetening again,Â either through the price or by cutting the acceptance hurdle one more time.Â AMSâs lenders may balk at either approach.The Austrian companyâs only certain way of reviving the takeover is to buildÂ an Osram stake exceeding 30% by buying shares in the market. That would trigger a requirement to bid under German takeover laws. The snag is that AMS canât amass that size of stake without securing certain antitrust approvals first.These dynamics should play into the hands of Bain and Advent, although theyâll have to counter the fact thatÂ AMS has already amassed a 20% stake in Osram. As such, a bid from the buyout firms would have to be at a level that forces AMS to sell. Implicitly that would be more than what it paid for its stake, assuming the Austrian group doesnât simply needÂ to raise cash at some point.Maybe Osramâs management will discover some new selling point that would persuade Bain and Advent to make a punchy proposal. But it would need to dig up some real gold. Thereâs no justification at present for the private equity firms going higher when they donât bring the cost savings that youâd get from merging two industrial companies.Having blown the best part of 800 million euros on that blocking stake, AMS still looks best place to prevail in the end. But unless something changes, the end â and a final price â could be some way away.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

As the biggest shareholder in the German lighting maker, AMSâs approval has become key for any would-be rival bidder. Osram has said private equity investors Bain Capital and Advent International are inspecting its books with a plan to make an offer.âWe doubt private equity will launch a superior bid given AMS has built up a 19.99% stake in the meantime,â Commerzbank said in a note. âWhile we cannot rule out that AMS might make another push, timing is yet unclear, so we attach a greater likelihood to a potential cooperation only.âGerman takeover law doesnât allow a new bid within one year unless the target gives its consent, as well as stipulating that an offer needs to be made if an investor crosses a 30% ownership threshold. AMSâs pursuit took a setback Friday, when it announced its offer failed to attract enough support from shareholders. Osram investors had tendered only 51.6% of their shares, short of a 62.5% threshold.Osram fell as much as 4.5% to 39 euros, the most in two months, while shares of AMS declined as much as 5.8%.AMSâs failed bid extends a period of protracted uncertainty for Osram, which emerged as a takeover target last year after warning trade friction and a cooling of the car industry had clouded the outlook for 2019. The former division of Siemens AG gets about half of its revenue from the automotive sector. Subsequent profit warnings further eroded investor confidence, sending shares tumbling until the takeover battle took hold.Osram confirmed talks with Bain and Carlyle, which was later replaced by Advent, in February after they were first reported by Bloomberg News. A bidding war broke out in July when AMS lobbed a higher offer. The Austrian company has drawn criticism from Osram unions and employee representatives on the board, as well as management due to concerns about promised synergies as well as the dealâs financing.Following the months-long takeover battle against private equity suitors, AMS said the combination remains compelling and pledged to continue to âexplore strategic optionsâ for a takeover. Bain and Advent are inspecting Osramâs books âwith a view to submitting an offer,â Osram said in a separate statement.AMS, a supplier of facial recognition technology for Appleâs iPhone, has said it would invest in the companyâs Regensburg, Germany site that makes high-tech chip components, but would sell the digital division that makes lighting controls, stage and theater lights.Century-old Osram, based in Munich, started out making light bulbs, pivoting in recent years under Chief Executive Officer Olaf Berlien to products like iris scanners and infrared emitters. The refocus was contentious, leading to a boardroom clash over strategy and a public spat with Siemens before the German engineering giant sold down its stake.To contact the reporter on this story: Oliver Sachgau in Munich at osachgau@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tara Patel at tpatel2@bloomberg.net, Elisabeth Behrmann, Jennifer RyanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-07,227.06,224.4,-2.66,-0.011714965,Don't move,1,21,540,23,4.2592592592592595

A New Orleans native educated at the California Institute of Technology, Stanford, and Columbia Business School, Rosen introduced Steve Jobs to Morgan Stanley and financed Compaq Computer, Lotus Software, and Electronic Arts. With his older brother, Harold, Rosen co-founded in 1992 aÂ hybrid car engineÂ car company that employed J.B. Straubelâlong before Straubel helped start Tesla Inc. In an interview at his home in Kent, Conn., Rosen, 86, looks back over his pathbreaking career and describes what excites him today. Here are some highlights.MARTY SCHENKER: You were there at the crossroads of some historic developments.BEN ROSEN: The timing was fortunate. I just happened to cross paths with some people who were really important in our lives. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were 22 years old. And then Gordon Moore. He was my teaching assistantâwhen I was a freshman at Caltech, he was a first-year graduate student. So Iâve known him since 1950, and we stayed in touch. Later, Compaq was Intelâs No. 1 customer. The inventor of the spreadsheet, Dan Bricklin, and his associate Bob Frankston, I knew. They showed it to me in the beginning. And Mitch Kapor, who took it to the next step. Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby, who invented the integrated circuit. Kilby got the Nobel. Bob didnât get itâonly because he was dead.MS: And Morgan Stanleyâs position as an underwriter of technology company initial public offerings [IPOs] started with your introductions.BR: First was the Apple IPO [in 1980]. Theyâd done one [technology IPO] many years ago, decades earlier. I donât even remember the name of it. They apparently lost their shirts on it. They were embarrassed. It violated their rules, which was to be the banker for the No. 1 or No. 2 major companies in the major industries. They took a chance on this company. It was a disaster, so they decided no more technology.MS: But then you introduced Steve Jobs?BR: To Bob Baldwin. And it was funny to watch them. This was at a small trade show at the Hilton a few blocks from Morgan Stanley. And Steve knew nothing about the financial world, and Bob [who led Morgan Stanley from 1973 to 1983] knew less about technology. And the two of them were each trying to sell themselves. Neither heard the other or understood what they were saying. But anyway, they [Morgan Stanley] became a big technology underwriter. I had just left Morgan Stanley, and I was a one-year consultant before I moved out altogether.MS: You could have been an early investor in Apple?BR: Mike Markkula, who is the original investor in Intelâhe bought a third of the company in 1976, I believe, for $91,000âone might call it really good venture investing. I knew him when I was an analyst. I used to see him at Intel. And he met Steve at a home-brew computer club in 1975. We were good friends, and he offered me $1 million of Apple stock at the time. I thought that somehow this was a conflict, even though Apple was a private company. I was an analyst. I was never on the banking side.MS: So do you follow technology now? What interests you?BR: Well, there are a lot of things that interest me. But to what extent? Iâm an optimist. I got the optimism from my brother. He was the inventor of the geostationary communications satellite. He would always see the glass half full.With something like climate change, I donât minimize the issues, but I think that the solutions are being minimized. And the way to do something is to fund science.The only investment Iâve made in 20 years, I just made [in Energy Vault SA]. Thereâs a longtime friend who runs an incubator in Pasadena, a Caltech graduate named Bill Gross. Heâs actually the inventor of something called paid search, and he had a company called GoTo.com that started before Google, and they created the system that allowed one to get paid for search online.He has a new invention now with another person, attempting to solve the single problem that is most impeding renewable energy, and that is storage.Nature does it by having a lake at a high altitude, and you can release the water when you need the energy to generate electricity, and when you have excess electricity you pump it up again. But all of the natural storage areas are taken. So Bill came up with the idea to emulate nature, but instead of using water to use concrete. So the [Energy Vault] system takes 35-ton concrete blocks, lots of them, in a solar field or a wind farm, and when theyâre generating energy thatâs not needed, they have a six-arm crane very high up that pulls these up. And when they need energy, the cranes let these things down and they generate electricity. Iâm not interested in appsâtheyâre useful and allâbut I like things that are grand, and this is grand.MS: When you started in venture capital in technology, it was a relatively new field.BR: This is â81. You could count on your hand how many venture firms there were. So what we were [Sevin Rosen Funds, founded with L.J. Sevin] was a startup only, just green fields. We didnât do, with very few exceptions, any secondary investments.MS: What always fascinates me is the difference between the person and the idea. How do you weigh those in your investments? Is it the idea or is it the person thatâs more important?BR: You mean in making the decision? The answer is yes.MS: [Laughs] So itâs both.BR: In some cases itâs one. For instance, in Compaq. At our initial meeting with the three entrepreneurs in Houston, they presented us with a hard drive for the then-just-introduced IBM PC. They were all at the hard-drive division at TI [Texas Instruments]. This is what they knew, and this is what they wanted to do. And we didnât think that was enough, for us anyway, to build a company with. We encouraged them to go back and come up with another idea because we liked them.Then they had a sketch of a portable PC. That sold us, and we invested in them because it was something that nobody was really doing at the time. The other thing we did was subtler but more important, and that was to make the first fully compatible PC with IBM. We knew IBM would get the business market, and we had to make something that a buyer and a customer wouldnât get fired for [having].Some peopleâTrip Hawkins at Electronic Artsâhe was at Apple before. We liked the guy, and he said he was going to become a game studio.One of the big risks is falling in love with a product. Because products usually have a lifetime, and if you donât have an organization that comes up with the next product and the next and the next, then it will be a short-lived investment.MS: There are people who are raising questions about [Apple Inc. CEO] Tim Cook and whatâs next after the iPhone.BR: Why donât you come up with another half-a-trillion-dollar product? Whatâs wrong with you? [Laughs]MS: In terms of people, Iâm also curious about your involvement in politics. You held the first fundraiser for Barack Obama, or among the first.BR: Not the first. I donât know who the others were, but yeah, weâd seen Barack Obama on television. This is before he declared in Springfield in February â07.We saw Mayor Pete [Buttigieg] on Charlie Rose a couple of years ago. He was just a mayor. And then we started hearing about him late last year. And so I wrote, âTo the mayor of South Bend, South Bend, Indiana: I would like to invite you to a fundraiser.âWith both of them it was hard inviting people. The first time, because Hillary was inevitable. We had a different problem with Pete because we sent the invitations in February, and he was really not known. And then 10 days before our meeting was the [Buttigieg] CNN town meeting, and that was really a spike. So we got 85 people to come to our apartment [in Manhattan].MS: Is there anything, looking back on your career, that you would love to have done differently?BR: Well, letâs see. I made a huge investment in a company my brother and I started, to make a hybrid electric power train for hybrid cars. Rosen Motors. It was one of those things that was an artistic success and a commercial failure. The technology was incredible. Some of it lives today in other companies, but not the promise that we had for it.Other things, well, if I got another chance, Iâd go to a liberal arts school because Iâm more interested now in the cultural world. I went to Stanford after Caltech, and I saw the difference, because it had a student body that was interested in everything.MS: So if someone in business school was interested in an entrepreneurial career, what would you advise him or her to do?BR: Iâd advise them to go to work in a company thatâs doing something that would provide requisite experienceâorganizationally, maybe technicallyâin what the real world is like. Even though I went to business school, I donât think itâs as helpful as getting industrial experience. And when I see now whoâs in venture capital firms, theyâre replete with people whoâve been in the industry. The other thing you learn by going into the real world is the network you develop. The network I got, even though it wasnât industrial, but just by starting a conference and by starting a newsletter, I knew everybody in the part of the technology world I was interested in. And it was invaluable.MS: You want to change philanthropy now?BR: We live near Lincoln Center, and when we go to the ballet, we go to David Koch hall, and when we go to the Philharmonic, we go to the David Geffen hall. But if a person could go to a ballet at the Balanchine hall or a concert at the Leonard Bernstein hall, it would have such a different impact. There are 60 buildings at Caltech that have names, but thereâs no Richard Feynman physics building, thereâs no Linus Pauling chemistry building. The largest single contribution that weâve made has been to start a biotechnology center at Caltech, and itâs a big deal there. And the woman who runs it, Frances Arnold, won the Nobel this past year. So the Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center is going to be the Frances Arnold Bioengineering Center.Schenker is Bloombergâs chief content officer in New York.To contact the author of this story: Marty Schenker in New York at mschenker@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Christine Harper at charper@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-04,227.01,227.06,0.05,0.000220255,Don't move,4,35,1821,43,2.361339923119165

It was rejected from Appleâs App Store because it âfacilitates, enables, and encourages an activity that is not legal,â Apple told the developer, according to a copy of the rejection notice seen by Bloomberg News. âSpecifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,â Apple wrote.On Friday, Apple reversed the decision and the app has been approved for sale in Hong Kong. âApple finally made the right decision,â the developer said.The developer said the app is built to âshow events happeningâ in Hong Kong, but what users choose to do with that information is their choice. âWe donât encourage any advice on the map in general. Our ultimate goal is safety for everyone.âOn Twitter, the developer had argued that the rejection was unfair because other apps, such as Googleâs Waze, help drivers avoid traffic cameras and police. Apple is assuming that HKmap.live users are lawbreakers âand therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the same,â the developer wrote on Twitter. By contrast, the app was approved for download on Android phones via a âquick process,â the developer added.The app was submitted to the App Store on Sept. 21. It was initially rejected on Sept. 26 for another reason related to rules on payment options and what additional functions apps can tap, the developer said. After addressing that issue, the app was re-submitted and rejected again on Oct. 2 for helping users evade law enforcement. The app was submitted for review again later that day, according to the developer.Apple has to walk a fine line in China. The company sells millions of iPhones in the country and indirectly supports millions of jobs there. But it must also follow local laws that have become increasingly tough when it comes to digital information. In 2017, the company set up a data center in China to abide by laws that require global companies to store information within the country. Apple also pulled some VPN apps from its App Store in China, limiting usersâ ability to bypass a local web firewall and access overseas sites.âWe would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,â Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said at the time. âWe strongly believe participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well.âApple couldnât immediately be reached for comment on the approval.Reviewing app decisions several times is a common practice. According to Appleâs website, the company rejects 40% of the 100,000 apps considered each week. It has what is known as an App Review Board to evaluate rejections.As part of its latest review of HKmap.live, Apple likely researched if the software violated local laws. Apple typically examines such laws before making approval or rejection decisions on third-party apps.The developer had hoped Apple would change its mind. The person had to buy an iPhone and a Mac computer to build the app for the companyâs platform. âAt least let me publish my app,â the developer said.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-03,220.82,227.01,6.19,0.028031881,Buy,11,19,611,41,6.710310965630114

The countryâs data regulator says the program breaches the European rule of consent and a privacy group is challenging it in Franceâs highest administrative court. It took a hacker just over an hour to break into a âsecureâ government messaging app this year, raising concerns about the stateâs security standards.None of that is deterring the French interior ministry.âThe government wants to funnel people to use Alicem and facial recognition,â said Martin Drago, a lawyer member of the privacy group La Quadrature du Net that filed the suit against the state. âWeâre heading into mass usage of facial recognition. (Thereâs) little interest in the importance of consent and choice.â The case, filed in July, wonât suspend Alicem.Digital IdentitiesWith the move, France will join states around the world rushing to create âdigital identitiesâ to give citizens secure access to everything from their taxes and banks to social security and utility bills. Singapore uses facial recognition and has signed an accord to help the U.K. prepare its own ID system. India uses iris scans.France says the ID system wonât be used to keep tabs on residents. Unlike in China and Singapore, the country wonât be integrating the facial recognition biometric into citizensâ identity databases. In fact, the interior ministry, which developed the Alicem app, says the facial recognition data collected will be deleted when the enrollment process is over. That hasnât stopped people from worrying about its potential misuse.âRushing into facial recognition at this point is a major riskâ because of uncertainties on its final use, said Didier Baichere, a governing-party lawmaker who sits on the Parliamentâs âfuture technologiesâ commission and is the author of a July report on the subject. Allowing mass-usage before putting in place proper checks and balances is âludicrous,â he said.[Related Story: Should Your Face Be Off-Limits in a Wired World?: QuickTake]No ConsentThe Android-only app with the blazon of the French republic, which Bloomberg was able to consult, will be the only way for residents to create a legal digital ID and facial recognition will be its sole enabler. An ID will be created through a one-time enrollment that works by comparing a userâs photo in their biometric passport to a selfie video taken on the app that will capture expressions, movements and angles. The phone and the passport will communicate through their embedded chips.Opponents say the app potentially violates Europeâs General Data Protection Regulation, which makes free choice mandatory. Emilie Seruga-Cau, who heads the law enforcement unit at the CNIL, the countryâs independent privacy regulator, said it has made its concerns âvery clear.â[Related Story: Where Tech Giants Are Getting Slapped Over Privacy: QuickTake]Security is another worry. Authorities say the security of Alicem is at the âhighest, state level.â Yet in April, Robert Baptiste, a hacker who goes by Elliot Alderson on Twitter, was able to access one of the governmentâs âhighly secureâ apps within 75 minutes, raising questions about the resilience of the stateâs online security.âBug BountyââThe government shouldnât boast that its system is secure, but accept to be challenged,â Baptiste said âThey could open a bug bounty before starting, because it would be serious if flaws were discovered after people start using it, or worse if the app gets hacked during enrollment, when the facial recognition data is collected.âOpposition lawmakers worry about the integration of facial recognition into laws to track violent protesters like during Yellow Vests demonstrations. Drago, whoâs challenging government plans on privacy and consent issues, said the absence of a debate âlets the state move ahead, without roadblocks.âMeanwhile, facial recognition tests are multiplying. Live camera surveillance in the streets of Wales was judged legal this month by a London court. Germany, The Netherlands and Italy use it for fast tracking borders checks. In August, Swedenâs Data Protection Authority fined the municipality of Skelleftea for testing facial recognition on high school students to measure attendance. Apple Inc. trivialized its use as a biometric to unlock mobile phones.Front-Runner?The EUâs new Commission, whose mandate begins in November, has among its goals the building of a âEurope fit for the Digital Age.â An internal policy document by the Commission detailed the steps the EU should take to master Artificial Intelligence technologies, including facial recognition.âThe wide-spread use of an equivalent of a public DNA is a challenge for regulators,â said Patrick Van Eecke, a privacy and data specialist at DLA Piper in Brussels. âYou can look at Franceâs use of facial recognition for digital identity in two ways: it goes too far in terms of privacy, or theyâre using the most secure new technology. Are they a front-runner or are they overstepping the mark?âTo contact the reporter on this story: Helene Fouquet in Paris at hfouquet1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, ;Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Vidya RootFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-03,220.82,227.01,6.19,0.028031881,Buy,1,5,867,7,0.8073817762399077

From the front, the Pro looks much like the 2017 iPhone X. But flip it around and youâll find the best camera system Appleâs ever devised. Use it for a while and youâll experience the best battery life too.Â With whatÂ Phil SchillerÂ dubbed the âfirst iPhone good enough to be called Pro,â Apple has mostly matched the specifications of Android rivals likeÂ Samsung Electronics Co.Â andÂ Huawei Technologies Co., which have had multi-camera systems for years. But itâs also taken a step further through superior software implementation. Appleâs triple-camera system is ahead of the pack in switching smoothly between lenses when zooming in and out, keeping exposure and image quality consistent. Thatâs especially helpful in video, where the iPhone 11 Pro extends Appleâs established lead as the industryâs best mobile video camera.Itâs part of the California giantâs new approach of selling services and industry-leading enhancements to a loyal fan base. Faced with a stagnating smartphone market and a user base happy with its existing devices, Apple this year stopped reporting product sales numbers and launched numerous initiatives to augment its growing portfolio. Apple Card got it into banking alongsideÂ Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Apple TV+ entered it into the streaming wars against the likes ofÂ Netflix Inc., and Apple Arcade turned it into a serious games publisher.Read more: Apple Bets on Cameras, New Pro Focus to Sell Latest IPhonesApple appears intent on reclaiming the mobile photography lead it lost when Googleâs Pixel was released three years prior â because the camera is critical to any device, and the latest iPhones need an edge. Thatâs true even if you buy intoÂ expectationsÂ in some corners that iPhone demand will hold up despite global trade ructions and stiffening Chinese competition.Most impressive among Appleâs photo upgrades is the new night mode, which takes two to three seconds to capture a burst of images and then combines them into one. It works just likeÂ Googleâs excellentÂ Night SightÂ on Pixel devices, except Appleâs solution is simpler as it kicks in automatically when needed. Appleâs night photo quality matches or surpasses rival systems including Googleâs.That means the iPhoneâs camera is again top of its class, turning a point of weakness over the past few years into a strength. But itâs no slouch in other key areas, either.The battery life of both iPhone 11 Pro models is superb, giving the user confidence it will last through a busy day without recourse to a charger âÂ which couldnât be said of their predecessors, the iPhone XS and XS Max. A fast charger is finally included in the box with the new Pro iPhones (though not with the basic iPhone 11 model), and Apple has also embraced the gesture-typing popular on Android devices with its iOS 13 keyboard.Â The fluidity of Appleâs interface and animations remains unrivaled, aided by an upgraded A13 processor, which will let Apple build more augmented-reality applications while helping establish 4K video recording as the new iPhone standard. Thereâs still occasional sluggishness with navigation, which suggests next yearâs iPhones might benefit from a greater memory allowance.Read more:Â  Without 5G, Appleâs New IPhones Risk Falling Behind in ChinaApple doesnât strictly need to win any spec or performance contest. Because many users feelÂ locked inÂ to their chosen ecosystems, itâs sufficient for Apple to demonstrate that its best iPhones are among the leaders. That has historically allowed the company to bypass the rush to reinvent the smartphone every year with cutting-edge tech like bezel-less displays, pop-up cameras or so-called waterfall edges that turn the sides of the phone into display. Apple has the luxury of choosing which new tech to adopt and when.That being the case, the lack of fifth-generation networking in this yearâs iPhone means AppleÂ will miss outÂ on a major upgrade cycle in China next year. Archrivals Samsung and Huawei already have 5G phones on the market.For the few people not committed to either iOS or Android already, the iPhone 11 Pro is also an invitation to join the Apple camp: It now offers top-notch camera quality alongside an extensive app ecosystem, effortless biometric security and consistently the best resale value.Â Â To contact the authors of this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.netMark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-02,218.96,220.82,1.86,0.008494702,Don't move,23,13,758,59,7.783641160949868

The Alphabet Inc. unit will offer access to the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program, which is designed to help prepare individuals for entry-level tech jobs through an online course that can be completed within six months.Google has made a concerted effort on these retraining efforts, in part, to address criticism that itâs artificial intelligence projects risk automating jobs away.Some 85,000 individuals globally have started the program, which is available at more than 25 community colleges in the U.S., since it debuted in 2018. Walter Bumphus, the president of the American Association of Community Colleges, and Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick were among those attending the event, the White House said.Google joins more than 300 companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. who have committed to the White House pledge, and the president regularly touts his daughterâs work on the initiative on the campaign trail.The announcement in Dallas comes as the stateâs attorney general, Ken Paxton, is leading a group of states investigating whether Googleâs business practices violate state or federal antitrust laws.Paxton said last month that he had âseen evidence that Googleâs business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated usersâ privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.â(Updates with information from Google in second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Gerrit De Vynck and Mark Bergen.To contact the reporter on this story: Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joshua Gallu, Jillian WardFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-02,218.96,220.82,1.86,0.008494702,Don't move,2,5,316,9,2.848101265822785

358,763,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-looks-rewrite-history-phone-212337486.html?.tsrc=rss,Microsoft Looks to Rewrite History on ItsÂ Phone Business,2019-10-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Now that Microsoft has restored some of its former glory, the company isÂ going for an even more unlikely comeback: rewriting the history of its much-maligned phone business.Three years after retreatingÂ from the smartphone business, Microsoft on Wednesday took the wraps offÂ the Surface Duo, a dual-screened handheld computing device coming in time for Christmas 2020. Yes, it makes phone calls and sends texts, even if Microsoft doesnât seem to want to call it a phone (or a comeback).The success of thisÂ surprise return to phone hardware could rest on how Microsoft intends to market it. The companyâs current lineup of Surface laptops and tablets is generally targeted atÂ the high end of the electronics market â corporate users and gadget enthusiasts who valueÂ the sharp design or need the ability to blend work and personal functions on one device. Microsoftâs overall strategy for the broader Surface hardware business has never been toÂ become one of the biggest laptop or tablet sellers, and the company has only a couple of percentage points of the worldwide tablet market, according to IDC. The question is whether the company will take the same approach with the Duo phoneâwill it be a hero device aimed at a small percentage of the market, meant to showcase how the companyâs cloud-based services work in a mobile world? Or is Microsoft aiming to pose a serious challenge to other smartphone makers? With the device a year away, itâs not clear if Microsoft has worked out its plan yet.At the unveiling in New York, Chief Product Officer Panos Panay took pains to focus on the Duoâs similarities to other Surfaces, even as he noted that the press and analysts in the audience would headline its ability to make calls and send texts. âYouâre going to talk about this as a phone,â he said when previewing it at the companyâs annual hardware event. âMake no mistake, this product is a Surface.â Panay even told Wired he doesnât want people to call it a phone.Â Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and other executivesÂ have frequently responded to questions about whether or when Microsoft would make a phone again by pledging that the company wouldnât do so unless it had a differentiated product and a significant point of view. In the Duo, the company thinks it has just that. A portable, foldable device with two screens âÂ not a folding screen like Samsung Electronics Co.âs Galaxy FoldÂ â that can merge Microsoftâs apps with those made for Googleâs Android operating system.Â Either way, the move is significant both strategically and in historical context. PhonesÂ became the white whale of Nadellaâs predecessor, Steve Ballmer, who negotiated theÂ $9.5 billion purchase ofÂ Nokia Oyjâs handset business in 2013Â in a desperate attempt to get traction in a growing market. Though designing and selling one model of a Surface phone is a smaller investment than that disastrous deal, another failure here would sting. It would also dent Nadellaâs reputation as Microsoftâs turnaround king and a shrewd judge of which businesses to home in on and which to jettison.Â Few things represent the impotence of Microsoftâs waning tech leadership in the aughts than its missteps in mobile. Indeed, even in a period whenÂ sales and profit roseÂ and Microsoft created massive businesses in Xbox and server software, it was the poor execution and strategy in phones that colored public perception of the company. Years before Apple Inc. and Google pioneered the modern smartphone market,Â Microsoft began its foray into phone software in the early 2000s âÂ and had fielded handheld-organizer programs even earlier than that.Â Yet its products never caught on. In 2007, then-CEO Ballmer publicly derided Appleâs first iPhone,Â and Microsoft mobile executives had the same take on Android, arguing that Windows already offered an operating system for phone makers to load on their handsets.As Android and Apple's iOS ate away at Windows Phoneâs market share, Microsoft increasingly looked to Nokia as a savior, first striking a partnership to put Windows on Nokia handsets. Ultimately Ballmer fought his board andÂ pushedÂ through a plan to acquire that handset business in the waning days of his tenure as CEO. Nadella, who had initially voted against the purchase when Ballmer polled his top executives, stuck with it. Less than 18 months later, that call came back to bite him as Microsoft had to write down almost the whole value of the deal. Microsoft fired most of Nokiaâs workers and exited the phone business.It wasnât just a major embarrassment â Microsoftâs phone debacle dealt a serious blow to its flagship Windows operating system, confining the software to theÂ declining desktop computer market and leaving the phone and tablet spoils for Apple, Google and Samsung.Microsoftâs announcement this week is a declaration that itâs back in the game â to what degree isnât yet clear. One thing, though, is certain:Â Nadellaâs Microsoft has a healthier sense of what the company is good at, and where it should just license technology from others who are further ahead. The Surface Duo will run on Googleâs Android, not Windows.Â Â To contact the author of this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-10-01,224.59,218.96,-5.63,-0.025067902000000003,Sell,18,24,858,60,6.993006993006993

If confirmed, Sylvie Goulard, who is picked to be internal market commissioner, and Margrethe Vestager, nominated to be the executive vice president for digital affairs in addition to her current role as competition chief, will ultimately decide the EUâs tech policies.Johannes Bahrke, a spokesman for the European Commission, declined to comment. âWe do not comment on leaks,â he said in an email.Tech PowerhousesThe document highlights the urgency of a debate over how Europeanâs tech community can produce powerhouses to compete with the likes of Apple Inc. or Huawei Technologies Co. European companies that produce the fundamental building blocks of technology -- including semiconductors and software -- have failed to keep up with the increasing cost of investing to stay competitive. Their U.S. counterparts have forged ahead in developing standards and products, while Asian companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. have mastered mass manufacturing at scale that European companies canât compete with.âIn principle we have good research capabilities in Europe, but we are under investing, and in many cases the talented researchers go elsewhere where they get better paid,â said J. Scott Marcus, a senior fellow with Brussels-based think tank Bruegel. âIn some critical areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning, the lead tends to be in the United States, and China is rapidly coming up. Itâs a big problem. Thereâs a whole innovation engine here that needs to be torqued up.âDuring her campaign for commission president, von der Leyen published a manifesto saying she believed it would be possible for Europe to achieve âtechnological sovereigntyâ in some areas, such as through investments in quantum computing, algorithms and data-sharing tools.She has pledged to unveil new legislation to support the ethical development of artificial intelligence within the first 100 days of her taking office. That could include introducing âdata passportsâ that would force companies to explain how their AI systems work, according to Politico, which has also obtained a copy of a briefing book for top officials.European Commission officials are said to be urging von der Leyen to set up a European Future Fund that would invest more than $100 billion in equity stakes in European companies, Politico reported.In written responses to lawmakers published in advance of the hearings, Goulard said she would try to help the bloc regain technological leadership by setting standards âto shape how technologies develop according to our own preferencesâ as well as supporting investments in cutting-edge technologies.âStrategic SafetyâThe document suggests such changes are overdue. Europe âis increasingly dependent on foreign technologies in key parts of its economy, some of them essential to our strategic safety,â the document states. In addition, it says, most computing technologies are âoften made elsewhere, in countries that do not necessarily respect European values and fundamental rights.âThe document recommends that the EU take âurgent stepsâ to increase its support for work in the fields of connectivity, hardware, data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The document expresses concerns that artificial intelligence technologies, if developed outside of Europe, could in the future âseverely harmâ the continentâs citizens and businesses.It suggests forming new public-private partnerships and tapping into burgeoning marketplaces in the western Balkans and Africa. Deploying the necessary technology across Europe would lead to â¬2.3 trillion ($2.5 trillion) in economic growth by 2030, according to the document.Once sheâs in office, von der Leyen wonât have the power herself to institute such changes. They would still need to be approved by the European Parliament and national European governments before implementation.&#92;--With assistance from Ian King.To contact the reporters on this story: Ryan Gallagher in Edinburgh at rgallagher76@bloomberg.net;Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Martin at amartin146@bloomberg.net, Virginia Van NattaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-30,223.97,224.59,0.62,0.0027682279999999997,Don't move,2,23,823,27,3.2806804374240586

The title -- developed in partnership with the state-run Peopleâs Daily -- lets players build a virtual metropolis from scratch while collecting cartoonish images of Communist slogans, national landmarks and politically tinged buzzwords such as âOne Country, Two Systems.âThe government is prepping to celebrate on Tuesday the 70th birthday of the Peopleâs Republic of China, at a time itâs grappling with major challenges to its authority from unrest in Hong Kong to a worsening economy buffeted by U.S. tensions. To whip up nationalistic fervor, the country plans to screen a string of patriotic films and televise a parade of military might through the heart of Beijing.Homeland Dream was Tencentâs latest attempt to cozy up to a government increasingly intolerant of its bread-and-butter business of gaming. The title was unveiled last month at the countryâs largest gaming expo along with another patriotic offering in partnership with the government of Guangdong province, its home base. Following a bruising 2018 crackdown, Tencent in May swapped its popular Battle Royale shooter PlayerUnknownâs Battlegrounds with a gore-free version that lionized the Chinese military. The revamp, Peacekeeper Elite, could generate $1 billion of gross revenue by the end of this year, Niko Partners estimated in June.Read more: Tencent Helps Communist Party Pay Homage to the China DreamAs of Monday, Homeland Dream had garnered an App Store rating of 4.6 stars out of 5 from nearly 5,000 reviews. But itâs not uncommon for game studios to benefit from fake downloads and ratings: Homeland Dream has dozens of nearly identical or irrelevant reviews giving it five stars.Players get to be in charge of transforming an undeveloped piece of land with eight slots, where they can place facilities from farmersâ markets to libraries and power plants.

The two federal inquiries are in addition to investigations by state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee.The simultaneous Facebook probes are a departure from the agenciesâ usual practice of dividing up scrutiny of companies based on staff expertise. They share antitrust enforcement power and often hammer out so-called clearance agreements, some of which can involve considerable behind-the-scenes wrangling, to avoid overlap.The FTC began its investigation of Facebook after striking an agreement in May with the Justice Department to divide four of the biggest tech companies between them. Under that deal, the FTC got jurisdiction over Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. while the Justice Departmentâs antitrust division took Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Apple Inc.For more: Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech AssaultThat agreement has now been overridden after Barr pushed to retain jurisdiction over Facebook, the person said. The agreement with the FTC didnât cover all conduct by the four companies, according to two people familiar with the matter. The Justice Department could also look at some of Amazonâs business practices, one of the people said.Justice Department officials feel obliged to carry out the departmentâs mandate to enforce the antitrust laws, especially given the widespread concerns over tech platforms, according to a third person familiar with the matter.FTC Chairman Joe Simons believes the Justice Department is infringing on its territory and wrote a letter to the department about the issue, according to one of the people. The Justice Department responded with its own letter, another person said. The FTCâs letter was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal.The FTC and Facebook declined to comment.Signs of the Justice Departmentâs interest in Facebook first emerged publicly at the end of July, when it announced a broad review of large technology platforms. While the department said it was looking at âsocial media,â it didnât specify any companies. Facebook disclosed that investigation to investors a few days later, without specifying whether it was a target.That July announcement followed a meeting between the FTCâs Simons and top Justice Department officials, including Barr, who expressed interest in looking at Facebook conduct, said the person.By then, the FTC was already forging ahead with its Facebook case. The agency is looking at social media, digital advertising and mobile applications, according to a Facebook disclosure.The jurisdictional dispute spilled into public view last week during an oversight hearing on Capitol Hill. Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah told Makan Delrahim, the Justice Departmentâs antitrust chief, and the FTCâs Simons that he was concerned about how they were dividing scrutiny of the tech companies.âIt sounds like your agencies may be pursuing monopolization investigations of the same companies at the same time,â he said. âNow, let me be clear, I donât think your agencies should be divvying up parts of a monopolization investigation of the same company -- tech company or, otherwise.âBoth Simons and Delrahim acknowledged that there had been disagreements.âI cannot deny there are instances where Chairman Simonsâ and my time is wasted on those types of squabbles,â Delrahim said.To contact the reporter on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Paula DwyerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-24,217.68,221.03,3.35,0.015389563,Don't move,1,6,622,8,1.2861736334405145

405,872,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-focuses-alexa-privacy-unveils-181845836.html?.tsrc=rss,Amazon Focuses on Alexa Privacy as It Unveils New Gadgets,2019-09-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. defended the privacy features of its Alexa digital assistant -- and introduced some new tools to reassure users -- following months of debate about the practices of the technology giant and its largest competitors.âWe care about this,â Dave Limp, leader of the companyâs devices business, said Wednesday at Amazonâs headquarters in Seattle. âPrivacy is absolutely foundational to everything that we do in and around Alexa.âLimpâs privacy pitch was unusual for a company most comfortable talking up product features and gushing about customers. But the e-commerce giantâs need for the trust of its users became clear as Limp introduced dozens of products and services designed to extend Alexaâs reach into more areas of life -- even going so far as to embed microphones in ear buds, eyeglasses and rings. The executive also introduced updated versions of Amazonâs mainline Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers, and a beefed up version, the Echo Studio, aimed at music lovers.Wednesdayâs event marked the third year in a row Amazon has held a September press showcase for new gadgets, highlighting the growing importance of the companyâs electronics franchise. Demand for Amazonâs devices, led by the hockey puck-sized Echo Dot and the Fire TV streaming stick, made it the third-top-selling brand by unit sales in the U.S. last year, according to estimates from researcher Euromonitor International. The company trailed only Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.Unlike those builders of high-end electronics, Amazon has achieved its scale primarily by selling low-priced devices that analysts estimate barely bring in enough profit to cover their manufacturing costs. The bet is a long-term wager on a virtuous cycle: more devices in more consumersâ hands means more viewers for Amazonâs original television shows, more subscribers to Amazon Prime, and more developer interest in building tools for Alexa.For much of this year, though, the attention paid to Amazonâs voice assistant has focused on what customer data it was picking up, and how Amazon was using the information.In April, Bloomberg News reported that Amazon had a team of people in offices around the world charged with reviewing a small sample of the consumer voice recordings heard by Alexa, a practice the company didnât explicitly disclose. News reports in the following months highlighted similar practices at Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Apple, among other companies.Limp introduced an opt-in feature that lets Alexa users automatically delete their verbal recordings regularly, on a rolling three-month or 18-month basis. Previously, Alexa users had to manually wipe out their stored voice recordings on a companion website. Amazon also added a privacy mode for its Ring home security cameras.âWe will continue to listen to customers, and Iâm sure theyâll have more ideas for usâ on new privacy features, Limp said.The company introduced a new model of the best-selling Echo Dot with a visual clock built in, and a high-end speaker to rival Appleâs HomePod, Google Home Max and Sonos Inc. speakers, called Echo Studio.A new Echo Show speaker comes with an 8-inch screen, adding to a line that already includes 5-inch and 10-inch displays. The Echo Flex, meantime, is a new category of the smart speaker that plugs directly into a wall outlet, unlike other Echo devices, which connect to outlets through a cable. The Echo Flex will integrate with new motion and light sensors and have an API so developers can write commands for it.Beyond tweaks to its Echo lineup, Amazon redoubled its efforts to take Alexa on the road, launching ear buds, eyeglasses, and even a ring that come equipped with the digital assistant. Alexa is perhaps the most well known voice assistant in the U.S., but its profile suffers from Amazonâs lack of a smartphone. Google and Apple, whose software powers almost all the handsets sold each year, have captive audiences for Google Assistant and Siri, which come preinstalled on devices.Limpâs roughly 90-minute presentation suggested there is hardly a corner of the high tech industry safe from Amazonâs desires for Alexa or its other products, from software for schools to a new Wi-Fi Mesh Router, and integration with GM cars and trucks. (But no waffle maker, Limp joked.)Amazon added a different kitchen appliance to its portfolio: a smart oven with an air fryer. Last year, the company announced its Alexa Microwave and said it quickly became the most popular microwave sold on Amazon.com. The new smart oven integrates with Alexa and will include an Echo Dot so users donât need extra devices to make it work with voice control.The beefed-up Echo Studio, aimed at music lovers, costs $200 and comes with 3D audio. Shares of Sonos, whose main business is digital-audio speakers, dropped 5% following Amazonâs announcement.Many owners of smart speakers use the devices primarily to listen to music or stream radio stations or podcasts. Amazon has lately sharpened its focus on audiophiles, launching a high-definition music streaming service earlier this month and, at a similar gadget event a year ago, introducing a range of subwoofers, amplifiers and other electronics designed to enhance Alexaâs profile as a music hub. Still, those devices havenât been mass-market hits, and some of them are among the more poorly reviewed gadgets in Amazonâs Echo line.(Updates throughout with product details, Amazon privacy push.)To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-24,217.68,221.03,3.35,0.015389563,Don't move,2,23,908,27,2.973568281938326

The earbuds will be cheaper than Appleâs $159 headphones, but require a smartphone to function as they wonât have cellular connectivity.High-End Echo: Look for Amazon to position a better-sounding Echo as a rival to Appleâs HomePod, the Google Home Max and the latest offerings from Sonos.Health tracker: The health and wellness bracelet is designed to pair with a smartphone app. Code-named Dylan, the device could even give Alexa the ability to recognize human emotions and offer wearers tips on how to interact more effectively with others.Home robot: People familiar with the project have said the bot, dubbed Vesta, could be a sort of mobile Alexa, accompanying customers in rooms where they donât have Echo devices.Amazon also will roll out annual upgrades to its existing array of Echo speakers and television set-top boxes. Look, too, for the company to continue its strategy of embedding Alexa in more device categories, as it has already done with a wall clock and microwave oven.Voice-activated gadgets are increasingly popular, despite concerns about how Amazon and other companies use the information picked up by their microphones. About 31% of U.S. households own a smart speaker, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Amazon accounted for about a quarter of the 26.1 million smart speakers sold worldwide during the second quarter, says researcher Canalys.To contact the reporters on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-24,217.68,221.03,3.35,0.015389563,Don't move,1,4,353,6,1.69971671388102

The TV academy aped the film academy in staging an awards show without a formal host, though it did have an announcer providing sports-style running commentary.With media giants rushing to introduce new streaming platforms, Amazon has sought to build a reputation for high-quality original shows. Itâs going to get harder to stand out. Walt Disney Co., Apple Inc., AT&T Inc.âs WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp.âs NBCUniversal will all roll out their services in coming months, setting up a historic fight for viewersâ eyeballs and wallets.Disney planted a flag early in the show with a commercial for its Disney+ streaming service, calling out its ownership of hit machines like Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar.Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the âFleabagâ creator, was nominated for best comedy and as well as best drama, for âKilling Eve.â That gave her a chance to match an accomplishment attained by prolific producer David E. Kelley in 1999, but the drama award went to âGame of Thrones.ââMaiselâ also won five Emmys last year. âSaturday Night Live,â meanwhile, took this yearâs Emmys for a variety sketch series.(Updates with best comedy Emmy in second paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Virginia Van NattaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-23,218.72,217.68,-1.04,-0.004754938,Don't move,1,4,319,6,1.8808777429467085

Customs and Border Protection determined it can administer the waiver from the levies when the goods enter the U.S. On Thursday, Appleâs request to win exemptions for the components had moved to an advanced stage in the approval process.Trump had signaled that relief from tariffs would be rejected, saying in a July 26 tweet that âApple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!âBut the president later told reporters âweâll work it outâ and that âI think theyâre going to announce theyâre going to build a plant in Texas.âBloomberg reported in June that Apple was shifting production of its new Mac Pro to China from a facility in Texas. The Cupertino, California-based company hasnât suggested there are plans for new factories in the state, though Apple has said it will expand its local headquarters there.Appleâs requests involved goods that are part of $200 billion in Chinese products hit with tariffs last September. Trump increased the duty on that batch to 25% from 10% in May. The rate is due to rise to 30% on Oct. 15, including on another $50 billion of goods also hit last year.Trump ordered duties on about $300 billion of essentially all remaining Chinese imports starting Sept. 1, but he delayed imposition on some consumer products until Dec. 15. Apple has said those duties would affect nearly all of its major products, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, AirPods and the iMac.Apple had so far asked for exclusions on Mac Pro parts and accessories, as well as its Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. Requests for tariff relief for the overall exterior enclosure, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad and some key internal components for the Mac Pro have been approved, while requests for wheels and other components are still under a substantive review by the USTR.Exclusion decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, is strategically important or related to Chinese industrial programs, and whether duties will âcause severe economic harmâ to the company or U.S. interests, the USTR has said.In its 15 requests for exclusions posted July 18, Apple said the devices or components are not related to Chinese industrial programs -- and that âthere are no other sources for this proprietary, Apple-designed component.âTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Niquette in Columbus at mniquette@bloomberg.net;Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-19,220.96,217.73,-3.23,-0.01461803,Don't move,6,11,484,23,4.75206611570248

Long lines snaked around Appleâs flagship on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan as people waited to get in to the gleaming glass cube and descend to the underground space, which as been under renovation for two years and emerged Friday bigger and brighter. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook was on site for the opening and stood out on the storeâs plaza across from Central Park taking selfies with fans.Sam Sheffer had already picked up his green iPhone 11 Pro in Manhattanâs SoHo store Friday morning, waiting in line for less than five minutes. But he went uptown to see the new store and potentially get a glimpse of Cook.âFor me, a die-hard enthusiast, I wouldnât be able to live knowing there was an iPhone I didnât have,â Sheffer said.Apple shares declined 1.5% to close at $217.73, valuing the company at almost $984 billion.Appleâs latest iPhone faced some hurdles heading in to its annual revamp. Sales of the iconic smartphone have declined in the past three quarters, as prices crept above $1,000 and people hung on to their current models longer. A lack of revolutionary features on this yearâs model could keep some fans holding out until 2020, when significantly faster 5G networks and a revamped design will open up new possibilities with the phone. At the same time, a trade war between the U.S. and China is also starting to take a toll.But some early reports from analysts pointed to encouraging signs for Apple. âDemand looks strong out of the gates for Apple as the lines at its flagship NYC store were up about 70% today compared to what we saw last year,â Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note to investors. Having talked to customers in line, Ives said there was âstrong demand for the base iPhone 11 as well as the 256GB iPhone 11 Pro in both the space grey and gold colors.â Ives said another positive sign for Cupertino, California-based Apple is that the lines were âunwavering into the afternoon.âApple set the base model price at $699 for the iPhone 11, down from the iPhone XRâs $749 price last year and below some analystsâ expectations. That might help attract some first-time buyers to its expanding entertainment and services ecosystem.Rosenblatt Securities Inc. said itâs seeing âsome new model production increases for September and October for the new iPhone models.â Jun Zhang, an analyst at Rosenblatt, wrote that the firm now sees volume increasing by 3 million to 5 million units more than earlier expectations, to 68 million to 70 million units.It may come as a disappointment to those waiting on line on Fifth Avenue, but if they havenât preordered their phone, they could face a two-to-three week wait, according to Zhang. Thatâs a longer wait time than the one-to-two weeks for last yearâs iPhone XR, but, âthere is a lot of inventory at other retailers,â Zhang said.Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison said Apple could be seeing a âpotential higher floor in iPhone demand,â and that âinitial iPhone search trends are positively surprising.âLines outside Apple stores around the world were typically shorter or non-existent this year, but tourists and customers thronged the Fifth Avenue location. Daniel Akinsulire found himself stuck deep in line on 58th Street, waiting to pick up phones for his family. âI didnât know it would be this packed,â he said. âI might be late for work.â(Updates with analyst comment in seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporters on this story: Molly Schuetz in New York at mschuetz9@bloomberg.net;Kiley Roache in New York at kroache@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-19,220.96,217.73,-3.23,-0.01461803,Don't move,20,16,690,56,8.115942028985506

Primarily, the committee is looking into whether Big Tech practices are harming customers or violating antitrust law, but are not necessarily looking into privacy (as other bodies are).When it comes to Google, the House is looking into a wide-range of antitrust concerns, including 25 businesses within the company. While the scope is large, Evercore's Kevin Rippey is not too concerned as âonly four of these areas of concern relate to the core search business,â which represents about 75% of the enterprise value.As a result, Rippey maintains an Outperform rating on GOOGL stock, with a $1,350 price target, which implies about 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Rippey's track record, click here)&quot;So long as the Houseâs efforts are focused on businesses other than Search, the magnitude of material financial risk may prove less than feared,&quot; Rippey opined. &quot;The Committee seems more focused on the companyâs ad tech complex...as well as the sharing of data between the Chrome, Android, Cloud, and advertising business lines.â Chrome will be a priority for the Committee, as it mentioned the browser four times in letter to the company. Besides Chrome, Rippey believes âAndroid and the app store remain areas of vulnerability.â Given the app storeâs &quot;monopoly control over app distribution,â Rippey thinks that app stores âare a key area of vulnerability under existing anti-trust law.â For better or worse, this is not Googleâs first time in an antitrust investigation. Last year, the company was fined $5 billion by the European Commission for Android-related antitrust violations. And with Big Tech is routinely and increasing receiving negative attention from presidential candidates in the Democratic party, this investigation is surely not the end of regulatorsâ focus on the tech giant. But like other tech companies, Alphabet stock continues to be one of Wall Street's favorites. TipRanks analysis of 33 analysts ratings on the stock shows a consensus Strong Buy, with 29 analysts rating the stock a Buy and four who giving it a Hold. The average price target among these analysts stand at $1,404.22, representing a 14% upside from current levels.

440,949,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stock-trades-monday-193123362.html?.tsrc=rss,"3 Top Stock Trades for Monday: ROKU, AMZN, S&P 500",2019-09-19,"It was a quadruple witching day on Wall Street, leading to extra volatility on Friday. Some late-session trade headlines didn't help matters. Let's look at a few top stock trades in deep detail. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: ROKUWe covered Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) earlier this week, but given the drumming that it took Friday -- down more than 20% at one point -- I thought it was worth looking at again. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares bounced on Thursday following a test of the 50-day moving average. However, they began Friday under pressure after Pivotal Research initiated the stock with a sell rating and $60 price target.   * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Where are we now?   The 100-day is at $109.70, while the gap-fill from the post-earnings surge is down at $100.97. Near there is the 50% retracement for the one-year range at $101.43. In between the downside levels (the gap fill and the 50% retracement), and the upside (the 100-day moving average), is Roku stock price. When shares were trading at $105.93 -- which they were at one point on Friday -- it was down 40% from its highs. From its peak, Roku stock fell about 60% in Q4. So this name has a tendency to shed some weight, but it has given investors an opportunity to get long too. A few lucky ones did. With 45 minutes to go in the session, Roku stock already surpassed 57 million shares traded. It feels greedy, but I would love to see Roku fill its gap back down to ~$101. A lower open on Monday that reclaims Friday's close would be the reversal that short-term traders need to get long this one again. Over the 100-day moving average could get a squeeze going up to the 38.2% near $119 and possibly the 50-day near $128.   If the gap-fill level and the 50% retracement doesn't hold, the August lows near $96 are on the table. A flush lower from there would be possible if buyers don't step up and defend Roku.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: AmazonWith the stock market near its all-time highs and with several mega-cap tech companies back in favor -- like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- it's interesting to see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) act as a laggard. Shares are down almost 12% off the July highs, when it looked like Amazon stock was going to breakout.  The stock has spent 2019 putting in a series of higher lows (blue line), although AMZN is threatening to break that trend should it continue much lower. Adding more weight to the current price action, the 200-day moving average is about $20 per share below current levels. Should AMZN lose uptrend support and the 200-day moving average, range support at $1,750 will almost instantly be on the table. Further, the 61.8% retracement is in this area too, at $1,757. If this area fails, then the June lows near $1,672 will be in the cards as Amazon stumbles into no man's land. On the upside, look to see how the stock does with the $1,850 area. There it has range resistance and the 50-day moving average. At $1,879 is the 78.6% retracement. Over this area puts $2,000+ back on the table. That's a lot of detail to absorb. So try to keep it simple. Below the 200-day moving average, and range support at $1,750 is on the table. Below that mark is bearish. If the 200-day holds, $1,850 resistance is on the table. Above that is bullish and over $1,880 puts $2,000+ in the realm of possibilities.In between is chop.  Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: S&P 500 (SPY)Many equity traders prefer to use the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) instead of the S&P 500. So let's take a closer look at the SPY. Interestingly, the SPY made a new 52-week high this week, while the S&P 500 did not. And while it hovers just below all-time high resistance between $300 and $301, investors having to digest a Fed day. That's shown on the charts via a blue box. I tweeted earlier on Friday that, once the SPY went below the Fed-day highs, it put the Fed-day lows on the table. So long as we remain beneath that mark, those lows remain on the table. Below the lows could create selling pressure.   In short, above the box is good, below the box is bad. Should the SPY reclaim the Fed-day highs and push over $300, then the recent highs at $301.24 are on the table and above that is blue sky. If the SPY takes out the Fed-day lows, we'll have to consider downside levels. The first downside mark is the 20-day moving average currently near $296 and below that is the 50-day at $239.65. Should the SPY fall below those levels, prior range resistance from August will be a key level to watch, between $292.50 and $293. Below that mark and we could really get some downside follow through.   * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf So again, to keep it simple: Over the Fed-day highs and upside can continue. Below the Fed-day lows and we have to be on guard. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Wlodarczak only just initiated coverage of ROKU stock today and that &quot;Sell&quot; rating isn't doing it any facors. In that same line, a price target of $60 per share is also ill Rokus news. It sits 55% below the stock's closing price on Thursday.So why exactly is Wlodarczak so pessimistic about ROKU stock? It all comes down to competition. Roku is going to be dealing with much more of that in the near future as more and more companies announce plans for their own set-top boxes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe problem for Roku is that is has strong competitors in the market all making announcements recently. That includes Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) offering free Xfinity Flex streaming devices to internet customers. There's also concerns from recently-announced streaming efforts being made by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), reports CNBC.  * 7 Triple-'F' Rated Stocks to Leave on the Shelf While these concerns aren't helping ROKU stock, it's worth noting that this isn't the general consensus among analysts. An average of 17 analysts are carrying an &quot;Overweight&quot; rating for the stock. They also have an average price target of $130.69, which is 2% below yesterday's closing price for ROKU.ROKU stock was down 18% as of Friday afternoon, but is up 311% since the start of the year.As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But the red-hot rally that took ROKU stock to such lofty levels was arguably way overdone. And in a similar fashion, the unrelenting selling in ROKU stock is getting a little overdone as well.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com What all that means is that it's time to position to be a buyer of Roku on any further weakness.The competition in the fiercely competitive streaming space just got taken up a notch yesterday, leading to yet another plunge in the ROKU stock price. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced it will give a free streaming box to current subscribers, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) introduced Portal TV.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis follows on the heels of such heavyweights as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Amazon making a move into internet media. While competing with the big boys can certainly crimp margins, ROKU does have the first mover advantage. Over 1/3 of all smart TVs now come with ROKU already installed.Michael Morris of Guggenheim upped his price target yesterday from $119 to $180, citing under-appreciated international growth opportunities. He also noted that ROKU is in a rare win-win-win-win arrangement with hardware manufacturers, consumers, content providers and advertisers. Although the upgrade was ill-timed given the massive drop in ROKU stock, the long-term thesis still remains valid.It's important to also remember that ROKU had a huge earnings beat last quarter. The company reported an earnings loss of 8 cents, much better than expectations for a loss of 23 cents. Revenues were also presentable, coming in at $250 million versus the $225 million analyst consensus. ROKU also raised its full-year guidance. The recent carnage in ROKU stock, however, has all but wiped out the gains made post earnings. ROKU Stock ChartsROKU is looking decidedly oversold from a technical perspective. Its 5-day RSI is now below 20 and at levels that have signaled a significant low in the past. Its MACD just reached the lowest reading of the year. Downside momentum is getting extremely bearish, while Bollinger Percent B is nearing negative. Meanwhile, ROKU stock held the 50-day moving average, while the 100-day average of $108.58 should provide additional downside support.ROKU saw some unusual option activity as well yesterday. Nearly 4,500 Sep 27 $140 calls traded versus only 261 open interest. This type of aggressive call buying likely means some big-time player is positioning for a pop in the ROKU stock price.The huge drop in ROKU yesterday -- nearly 14% -- also drove up implied volatility. This means option prices are more expensive, favoring selling strategies when constructing trades. So to position to be a buyer of ROKU at even lower levels, an out-of-the-money bull put spread makes strategic sense. Trade Idea for ROKUBuy the ROKU Nov $95 put and sell the ROKU Nov $100 put for a $1 net credit.The maximum gain on the trade is $100 per spread with maximum risk of $400 per spread. Return on risk is 25%. And the short $100 strike price provides a 23% downside cushion to the $123.98 closing price of ROKU stock.Tim may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

In 2017, before the trade war started, Apple was fifth in this ranking. Meanwhile, Appleâs biggest local rival, Huawei Technologies Co., climbed two spots and came in second, behind only Chinese payment service Alipay.The shuffle in the rankings is a sign of the growing challenge American brands face in the second year of Donald Trumpâs tariff showdown with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The survey findings show Chinese consumers growing cooler towards some American brands, especially after smartphone giant Huawei saw its Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, arrested in Canada last year at the behest of the U.S. government.Trump followed with a ban on Huawei products, which helped fuel a surge of local support for the Shenzhen-based brand, according to Jay Milliken, senior partner in Hong Kong with Prophet, the San Francisco-based consultancy that conducted the survey of 13,500 Chinese consumers.Prophetâs survey, conducted annually, this year asked Chinese consumers in large cities for their views on more than 250 brands across 27 categories. Respondents evaluated brands they used or were considering using, rating rated their relevance to the lives of consumers based on qualities such as innovation, usefulness and dependability.âNationalistic BuyingââThereâs a lot of nationalistic buying in that category, because Chinese consumers interpreted what happened to Huawei as an attack,â he said.Patriotism helped fuel the rise of other Chinese brands, too. Sportswear maker Li Ning Co. cracked the top 40 for the first time, ranked No. 34, just two spots behind market leader Nike Inc.Named after its founder, the famous gymnast, Li Ning capitalized on the nationalistic sentiments of many Chinese consumers with the launch last year of a China Li-Ning collection at New York Fashion Week that heavily used red and yellow, Chinaâs national colors.There were only two American names in the top ten this year -- Android at No. 3 and Intel at No. 9 -- compared to five in the 2017 survey.Switching AllegiancesUnlike Apple, Android and Intel donât have to worry about consumers switching allegiances to local competitors, Milliken said, and that explains why they manage to remain highly ranked.âSome Western brands are so integral in the lives of Chinese consumers, theyâre almost predisposed to not losing relevance,â he said. âThere are no Chinese alternatives so those remain super relevant.âGeopolitical tensions arenât the only problem Apple faces in China, its biggest market after the U.S.While Beijing is pushing to make the country a leader in the introduction of high-speed 5G networks, Appleâs phones -- even the newly announced iPhone 11 -- donât support that latest wireless standard.To contact the reporter on this story: Bruce Einhorn in Hong Kong at beinhorn1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Emma O'Brien at eobrien6@bloomberg.net, Bhuma Shrivastava, Rachel ChangFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-19,220.96,217.73,-3.23,-0.01461803,Don't move,4,9,499,17,3.406813627254509

Fellow Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. is trading at 17.8 times estimated earnings for the next four quarters.Rich valuations are nothing new on the Star market, where regulators removed an unwritten valuation cap on companies going public that has led to some eye-popping multiples. Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences Co. set a record on the tech board with an IPO price that represented an earnings multiple of 467.51 times.Since founding the Tecno Mobile brand in 2006, founder Zhu Zhaojiang has overseen an expansion that now claims a 48.7% market share in Africa, according to a previous filing. Transsion shipped 94.44 million mobile phones to Africa in 2018, out of a total of 124 million global shipments.The sky-high valuations on the Star market have been met by equally elevated gains.

The iPhone maker is the biggest target of EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestagerâs crusade against corporate tax deals that allow big firms to reduce their fiscal burden.Irish BranchesThe five-judge panel homed in on the exact functioning of the Irish branches that allowed Apple revenues to be covered by a national tax deal labeled as illegal by regulators.The EU asserts the units received selective tax treatment that allowed Apple to allocate all sales profits to two companies that âexisted only on paper.â Apple attempted to show that each business wasnât a ghost while saying strategic decisions over products and sales were made elsewhere and profits should also be taxed elsewhere.âThis wasnât some kind of shell company, this was a company doing things in the U.S.,â Appleâs lawyer Daniel Beard responded, citing one of the firms. He said that no critical decisions on intellectual property were made in Ireland.Marc van der Woude, a Dutch judge and the courtâs vice-president, had quizzed the EUâs lawyer late Tuesday on what evidence the European Commission had to show whether the Apple units determined strategy or drew up business plans.The business &quot;looks like a phantom company,â he said at one point. Other judges dug into details of how the branches were run and how the Irish government determined that the revenue should be taxed there.The EUâs lawyer Richard Lyal sought to dismiss Appleâs arguments that the revenue at stake should have been taxed in the U.S. where its products are developed.&quot;Apple should not now pretend&quot; that its Irish units &quot;make all that money but that only a tiny proportion of it should be attributed to Ireland,&quot; he told the court. &quot;All arguments as to tax being paid in the U.S. are completely irrelevant.&quot;Amazon, AlphabetA court ruling, likely to take months, could empower or halt Vestagerâs tax probes into complicated corporate structures used by many American technology firms. The EU has also scrutinized fiscal deals done by Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. and may draft new rules to net digital companiesâ revenue.The first hints of how the Apple case may turn out will come from a pair of rulings scheduled for Sept. 24.The General Court will rule on whether the EU was right to demand unpaid taxes from Starbucks Corp. and a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV unit. Those judgments could set an important precedent on how far the EU can question tax decisions national governments make on how companies should be treated.To contact the reporters on this story: Aoife White in Luxembourg at awhite62@bloomberg.net;Stephanie Bodoni in Luxembourg at sbodoni@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net, Peter Chapman, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-17,220.7,222.77,2.07,0.009379248,Don't move,10,34,621,54,8.695652173913043

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger resigned from Apple Inc.âs board, a sign of increased competition between the entertainment and technology giants.Apple said in a Friday regulatory filing that Iger quit on Tuesday. He had served as a director since 2011 and was a friend of Steve Jobs. The Apple co-founder was also a Disney board member until he died in 2011. The duo appeared on stage more than a decade ago to announce an iTunes partnership.The relationship between the two companies became more fraught after Apple expanded into original TV shows and movies, making the Cupertino, California-based company a potent new rival for Disney. That had put Igerâs role on Appleâs board in doubt.On Tuesday -- the same day Iger resigned from the board -- Apple CEO Tim Cook said the companyâs TV+ service would launch Nov. 1 for $4.99 a month, undercutting the upcoming Disney+ offering. The announcement dented Disney shares.In an April interview with Bloomberg TV, Iger said he was careful to recuse himself at Apple board meetings whenever the topic of streaming video came up. He added that the topic âhas not been discussed all that muchâ by the Apple directors, because it was relatively small and nascent. âSo far itâs been OK,â he said. âIâm in constant discussion about it.ââIt has been an extraordinary privilege to have served on the Apple board for eight years, and I have the utmost respect for Tim Cook, his team at Apple and for my fellow board members,â Iger said in an emailed statement.His departure leaves Apple with seven board members. The average board has 10.8 directors, according to a 2018 analysis of companies in the S&P 500 index by Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm that provides executive search and board-related services.&#92;--With assistance from Christopher Palmeri.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-12,223.085,218.75,-4.335,-0.019432055,Don't move,10,5,340,25,7.352941176470589

Additionally, another report out this morning showed retail sales in August rose 0.4% and that the July reading was revised higher.&quot;The resilient reading shows American consumers may be poised to shake off trade war and global slowdown to support the record-long economic expansion as the labor market holds up,&quot; according to Bloomberg.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession In recent months, I've noted many times in this space the importance of the U.S. consumer and that many of the recession calls were likely premature because the market has not absorbed material deterioration in consumer data to date. I'll stick by that thesis because the preliminary September sentiment reading seems to indicate the August result was a bump in the road, not the start of a negative trend.Today, the Nasda Composite finished lower by 0.22% while the S&P 500 dropped 0.08%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.13%, extending its winning streak to eight days. In late trading, 16 of the Dow's 30 components were pointed higher. Pleasant Surprise for Dow Component UNHIt was interesting if not surprising to see UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a frequent guest of this space, rank as one of the best-performing names in the Dow today. I say surprising because there was a democratic debate last night, an event that typically weighs on stocks like UNH. I missed the goings on, but I'll assume whatever Medicare For All talk that took place was not strident enough to derail UNH shares today.Staying with the healthcare theme, don't read too much into today's bounce in pharmacy name Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a consumer staples name with sizable drug price exposure, because two of the Dow's three pharmaceuticals names finished lower today. This is another hot-button issue investors need to be aware of going forward.&quot;An ambitious draft plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to allow government price negotiation on a swath of expensive drugs has shifted Washington's contentious policy debate leftward at a critical point for Democratic negotiations with Senate Republicans and the White House,&quot; reports Modern Healthcare. BA Flying HigherBoeing (NYSE:BA) continued trending higher, gaining 1.06% today as the company makes progress toward getting the 737 MAX jet airborne again. A deeper analysis of that issue and other important points on Boeing stock is available here.There seems to be some momentum for Boeing getting the jet back in the skies before the end of this year, Wall Street's desired time horizon, but by the company's admission, it doesn't control the timeline.&quot;The timeline is in the hands of divided regulators around the world who must approve Boeing's proposed software fix for 737 MAX flight controls and new training materials. European regulators plan their own test flights on the changes,&quot; reports Reuters. Fighting BackWith a decline of about 2%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That's not something that happens very often, so when it does, it's fair to surmise there's a reason for the Apple weakness, albeit temporary.Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall cut his price target on Apple shares today to $165 from $187, saying the company's recently unveiled $4.99 per month price on the Apple + streaming TV service is aggressive and could hamper the company's earnings.Apple rebutted the analyst, saying it doesn't expect Apple + to materially impact results. Bottom Line on Dow JonesThere are just a couple of weeks left in the the third quarter, meaning another earnings season is fast-approaching. I'll leave you with a glance at some of the sectors analysts are bullish and tepid on this quarter.&quot;At the sector level, analysts are most optimistic on the Energy (66%) sector, as this sector has the highest percentage of Buy ratings. It is interesting to note that the Energy sector is projected to report the largest earnings decline of all 11 sectors in CY 2019 (-20.9%) and the largest earnings growth of all 11 sectors in CY 2020 (30.2%),&quot; said FactSet.The research firm notes analysts are not enthusiastic about consumer staples as that sector has the lowest percentage of &quot;buy&quot; ratings and the highest percentage of &quot;sell&quot; calls.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Goldman is merely the latest example of growing caution as it cut its price target to one of the lowest on the Street.The consensus rating for Apple -- a proxy for its ratio of buy, hold and sell ratings -- stands at 3.76 out of 5. According to Bloomberg data, that matches the lowest since the first half of 2004.Shares of Apple fell as much as 2.7% on Friday, though it last traded down 1.9%. The stock has risen more than 13% off an August low and is less than 6% below its record close. While it slipped back under the threshold with Fridayâs decline, its valuation returned above $1 trillion for this first in 2019 this week.Goldman analyst Rod Hall cut his target to $165 from $187, warning of a âmaterial negative impactâ to the companyâs earnings per share as a result of a plan to offer a trial period for its Apple TV+ service.Apple responded to Goldmanâs report in an email: âWe do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.âGoldmanâs new target is 26% below Appleâs Thursday close, and while Hall has a neutral rating on the stock, there are only a couple of firms with a target below Goldmanâs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average target is about $219, matching the current share price.In addition to Goldman, recent cautious calls have included New Street Research cutting its own price target earlier this week and warning of a âmulti-year declineâ in iPhone demand.On Friday, Rosenblatt said it was seeing âweakâ pre-orders for the latest version of the iPhone. The research firm has a Street-low price target of $150 on Apple stock, and it downgraded the shares in July. That brought the number of sell ratings to five, the highest number since at least 1997, according to historical data compiled by Bloomberg.All five of the sell ratings have come this year. In January, the number of firms with buy ratings dropped below 50% for the first time since 2004.(Adds Apple comment in sixth paragraph and Rosenblatt iPhone warning in eighth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Tatiana DarieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-12,223.085,218.75,-4.335,-0.019432055,Don't move,11,15,438,37,8.447488584474886

It will also be free for one year with purchases of new Apple devices. This is relatively rare for a company that has historically charged premium prices to support healthy profit margins.Rod Hall, the Goldman Sachs analyst who covers Apple, cut his price target on Apple shares to $165 from $187, saying the companyâs plan to offer a trial period for TV+ was âlikely to have a material negative impactâ on average selling prices and earnings per share.âWe do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results,â Apple said in an email.The stock jumped after the statement, trimming losses from earlier in the day. It traded down 1.8% at $219 at 2:56 p.m. in New York.The TV+ service is entering a crowded video-streaming field that already includes Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Hulu and AT&T Inc.âs HBO. In November, Walt Disney Co. plans to launch a Disney+ streaming service, with a giant catalog of titles, for $6.99 a month. Netflixâs entry-level subscription is $8.99 a month in the U.S.Apple, which doesnât currently have a back catalog of content for TV+, announced the $4.99-a-month pricing on Tuesday, sparking a rally in its shares and declines in Netflix and Disney stock. In India, the TV+ service will be 99 rupees ($1.40) a month.

519,1107,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-j-abramss-bad-robot-170141463.html?.tsrc=rss,J.J. Abrams's Bad Robot Better Be Good at AT&T,2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Careful, AT&T, those Hollywood lights can be blinding. The industry newbie has just struck an eye-poppingÂ deal with sought-after director J.J. Abrams to bring more of his movie magic to the telephone-giant-turned-media-conglomerate. AT&T Inc.âs offer amounted to:Â Dear J.J., please take this wheelbarrow ofÂ money.Â The deal between AT&Tâs new WarnerMedia division andÂ the Bad RobotÂ production company, led by husband-and-wife team Abrams and Katie McGrath, is reported to be worth more than $250 million. Thatâs after Apple Inc. bid $500 million, according to Hollywood Reporter, though Abrams wasÂ said to have turned down that offer in part because he wanted to maintain a large box-office presence. With WarnerMedia, Abrams can create contentÂ for both the big screen and online-streaming properties. Bad Robot has previously produced hits such as âStar Wars: The Force Awakens,â and the shows âLostâ and âAlias.âÂ The outrageous sums that AT&TÂ and reportedly Apple put forth areÂ emblematic of the escalating arms race for content. Entertainment giantsÂ âÂ those new to the business, in particular â are trying to secure hit TV series and films for new streaming-video services launching in the coming weeks and monthsÂ to compete withÂ Netflix. Apple TV+ is set to be released Nov. 1, followed by Disney+ on Nov. 12 and AT&T/WarnerMediaâs HBO Max next spring. (Last year, AT&TÂ acquired WarnerMedia, formerly called Time Warner, the parent of Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, TBS and other networks.) While most ofÂ these relatively low-priced subscriptions are years away from being able to turn a profit, the media giants are willing to bear the cost and pay up for the content to attract and keep customers.But WarnerMedia also threw in an unusual perk for Abrams:Â He gets to own potentially as much as a 50% stake in the projects he creates for the company, according to NBC News. The inclusion ofÂ a term like that, combined with the value of the contract, makes the dealÂ lookÂ like a rookie move by WarnerMedia and the executive spearheading its streaming strategy,Â John Stankey, a three-decade veteran of AT&Tâs phone business. Either that or desperation. Virtually noÂ other media or tech giant would likely agree to give up those content rights. In fact, Walt Disney Co. is moving to cut back on the profitsÂ it shares with showrunners and stars after hit series pass the crucial 100-episode mark and enter into lucrative syndication deals,Â according to the Los Angeles Times. Disney wantsÂ control over thatÂ future licensing windfall, preferring to instead divide profits earlier on, when they arenât quite as big.Itâs no wonder that after Disney, Comcast Corp., Viacom Inc., Sony Corp.Â and Netflix Inc. were all said to have looked at Bad Robot, AT&T and its new media mogulsÂ landed the deal.Â Stankey, known for aÂ brusque management style, has already hadÂ a rough start when it comes toÂ gaining the respect of his new media employees and shaping the vision for WarnerMedia. It's part ofÂ the reason shareholder Elliott Management Corp. launched an activist campaign at AT&T this week, calling for more operational focus and a clearer strategy.Â AT&TÂ CEO Randall Stephenson recently promoted Stankey to chief operating officer in addition to his role presiding over WarnerMedia specifically.Stankey and Stephenson arenât the only industry outsiders starstruck by Hollywood and feeling the pressure to pay whateverâs necessary to expand streaming-app libraries andÂ keepÂ viewers fromÂ canceling subscriptions. Apple TV+ has reportedly dished out $300 million for the first two seasons of âThe Morning Show,â an original series starring big names like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Disney+ spent about $15 million on each episode of its âStar Warsâ series, âThe Mandalorian,â which adds up to the cost of a big-budget film.Â But AT&Tâs leadersÂ are showing their inexperience in the world of content and entertainment, driving away key internal personnel while so eagerly courting Abrams. The companyâs post-deal turnover wasÂ punctuated by the high-profile exits of HBOâs Richard Plepler and Turnerâs David Levy earlier this year.In reporting on theÂ Abrams deal, Bloomberg News also uncovered an interesting detail about what actually happened toÂ Kevin Tsujihara. Heâs the former head of Warner Bros. who left in MarchÂ amid a sex scandal involving an actress with whom he was having an affair while helping to land film roles. At first it seemed like Tsujihara was going to stay on despite the scandal, and in fact he had even just been promoted by Stephenson. However, Bloomberg reports that Abramsâs wife, McGrath, essentially gave AT&T an ultimatum, saying thatâd it be hard for Bad Robot and WarnerMedia to work together if Tsujihara was there. It all makes sense now.As for the deal, Stankey had better hope Bad Robot makesÂ good movies, because it seems none of his industry peers were willing to offer what he did.Â To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

537,1125,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thursday-vital-data-aurora-cannabis-133415767.html?.tsrc=rss,"Thursdayâs Vital Data: Aurora Cannabis, Boeing and Apple",2019-09-12,"U.S. stock futures are extending yesterday's gains. The big boost came last night when President Trump announced via Twitter a delay in the planned increase of tariffs toward China.Source: Shutterstock Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.22%, and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.22%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.63%.Wednesday's optimism in equities spilled into the options pits with call volume running hot. Approximately 22.4 million calls and 18.6 million puts changed hands on the session. The call surge made waves at the CBOE as well. The equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.54, while the 10-day moving average dropped toward 0.62 -- a six-week low.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions activity was a mixed bag on Wednesday (Options traders zeroed in on analyst actions yesterday). Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) saw renewed options interest ahead of fourth-quarter earnings, which disappointed. Boeing (NYSE:BA) boomed to a five-month high on strong volume. Finally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rallied to a new 2019 high after unveiling its Apple TV+ service.Let's take a closer look: Aurora Cannabis (ACB)A powerful rally carried Aurora Cannabis into last night's earnings release. Unfortunately, the optimism was misplaced and ACB stock is trading down 10.5% premarket. For the fourth quarter, the Canadian Cannabis company posted net revenue of C$98.9 million, which came in below the range Aurora Cannabis forecasted just last month.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now The adjusted EBITDA loss was C$11.7 million. Last quarter, the company had stated they expected positive earnings for Q4.On the bright side, because ACB stock experienced a run-up ahead of the number, this morning's thrashing is only returning its price to Monday's low. Continued weakness could lead to a retest of its 52-week low at $5.38, though.As far as options trading goes, traders were chasing calls throughout the session. The mad dash pushed total activity to 325% of the average daily volume, with 123,106 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 75% of the day's take.Pumped up premiums were pricing in an earnings gap of 72 cents or 11%. So, with ACB set to open down just shy of 11%, I'd say the derivatives market absolutely nailed the move -- three cheers for market efficiency. Boeing (BA)Boeing shares exploded higher yesterday, breaking a key short-term resistance zone. Volume pushed to 8.4 million shares reflecting a buying stampede. The culprit seems to be the ongoing rotation seen in the overall market. Over the past week, we've seen many leaders lag while laggards have led.This week's behavior in BA stock provides a teachable moment. My morning Google search revealed a spate of ominous-sounding news headlines for the wounded Aerospace company. Here are a few: &quot;When Does Patience Run Out for Boeing Stock?,&quot; &quot;New Blow for Boeing,&quot; and  &quot;The Boeing 777x Suffers Another Setback.&quot; And yet, despite the drama, BA stock is booming over the last two trading sessions, proving once again that news is often noise and price is king.BA now sits above all major moving averages and has seen a ton of improvement in volume patterns. Distribution days have disappeared, and accumulation is making a comeback. Consider $400 the next upside targetOn the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a modest margin. Activity swelled to 209% of the average daily volume, with 174,949 total contracts traded. Calls added 63% to the session's sum.Fear and uncertainty have all but unwound. Implied volatility tumbled to 27% or the 21st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $6.50 or 1.7%.  * 7 Strong-Buy Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Now  Apple (AAPL)After a volatile ride post-earnings, Apple shares are back to booming. The stock rocketed 3.2% higher yesterday finally eclipsing a ceiling which had kept a lid on it for four months. Volume soared alongside the rally with over 44.3 million shares changing hands.With resistance cleared, AAPL stock is now positioned to attack last year's $233.47 peak. That's your next upside target.Not surprisingly, calls dominated the options trading. Total activity climbed to 206% of the average daily volume, with 933,345 contracts; 65% of the trading came from call options alone.The improving price trend has taken the wind out of implied volatility's sails. Yesterday it dropped to 26% or the 22nd percentile of its one-year range. With premiums now only pricing in daily moves of $3.63 or 1.6%, buying options is better than selling them right now.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Per the Labor Department August jobs report, unemployment, at 3.7%, remains at 50-year low levels, wages are up 3.2% year-over-year, and overall GDP growth, at 2%, continues to outpace the estimates. Earlier US Commerce Department data showed an acceleration in consumer spending for July. In this environment, it makes sense to look for investment opportunities in the companies catering to consumer desires. Weâve used TipRanksâ Trending Stocks tool to find three such openings for investors. We set the filters on the Trending Stocks tool to show us only companies in the Consumer Goods category. These retailers offer a wide variety of products on the open market: from high-end electronics to athletic apparel to discount home goods. We selected three stocks that hold Buy ratings from the consensus, have shown sustained growth so far this year, and boast recent gains in double digits. Wall Streetâs top analysts have taken notice of them, as should we. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Yesterday, CEO Tim Cook hosted his companyâs new product release event, and his presentation shows that Apple (AAPL â Get Report) is fully committed to pushing its Services division for higher revenues. The company announced that its new Arcade game subscription service will be priced at just $4.99 per month and will include a free one-month trial. Apple TV, soon to launch as a competitor to Netflix (NFLX  â Get Report) in the streaming space, will be priced at just $5.99, raising the possibility that Apple intends to ignite a price war among content streamers. And finally, Cook announced that the TV streaming service will be offered free for one year with new purchases of Apple hardware â a clear move toward monetizing the companyâs 900 million strong installed user base.On the hardware front, the new iPhone 11 models include faster processors, updated cameras, and lower pricing. Taken with the Services push, the conclusion is that Apple is serious about shifting its marketing strategies to maintain high profits as iPhone sales decline.Since AAPLâs steep losses in last yearâs second-half downturn, Apple has faced and beaten a number of headwinds. Falling sales in China, the ongoing US-China tariff disputes, and the lengthening smartphone replacement cycles have taken their toll on the companyâs sales and revenues. To fight the difficult market environment, Apple has relied on a shift in strategy backed by over $200 billion in cash on hand. Deep pockets and smart management have given confidence to investors.The confidence can be seen in share appreciation. Apple is up 41.7% year to date, 16.6% in the last 3 months, and 12.5% in the last 30 days. AAPL shares are currently trading just $4 below its all-time high value (adjusting for the 7:1 split in June 2014). Optimism in the company can also be seen in the analyst coverage.Michael Walkley, of Canaccord Genuity, set the tone with this simple statement: âThe Apple launch event met expectations as the company unveiled attractively priced products to drive its installed base growth.â His $240 price target suggests a 7.3% upside potential.Needhamâs Laura Martin went into greater detail, writing, âThe company is continuing its transition to becoming an integrated content owner with captive hardware by driving more revenue per member and extending the life-span in its iOS ecosystem. The event also helped underscore Apple's efforts in creating an on-ramp into that ecosystem. Apple's broader range of iPhone prices, monthly payment plans, value in bundling Arcade and Apple TV offerings, as well as creating a content &quot;price war&quot; by pricing AppleTV+ at just $5 per month will put pressure on the competition.â Her price target of $250 indicates a potential 11.8% upside.Itâs important to note that Appleâs price surge, both before and after the launch event, has pushed the stockâs trading value above its average price target of $224. Since September 7, AAPL has gained 5.7% in price. The stock has a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 32 ratings including 17 buys, 13 holds, and 2 sells. Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (LULU)The popular athletic wear manufacturer Lululemon (LULU â Get Report) has become a hot seller, boosted by smart social media marketing and a solid online presence. Its success is underlined by its Q2 earnings report, in which the company reported 96 cents EPS, beating the 89-cent forecast by 7.8%. Revenues were up by 4.6%, at $883.35 million. It was the fourth quarter in a row that LULU had beaten EPS and revenue estimates.Lululemonâs strong sales performance, maintained over time, matches its share price gains. LULU is up 11% in the last 30 days, capping a 61.5% year-to-date gain. Fast growth has been powered by moves into new categories, including menâs wear. The companyâs menâs line gained 35% in the quarter.Writing from Oppenheimer, analyst Brain Nagle said, âBetter sales combined with further expansion in gross margins and tighter expense controls helped to fuel meaningful upside to earnings per share. By all measures, we view fundamental momentum at Lululemon as solidly intact.â Nagleâs price target of $225 suggests additional upside of 14% for the stock.Also bullish on LULU is Michael Binetti, of Credit Suisse. He raised his price target by 18%, to $235, and wrote, âWe are significantly impressed that Lululemon accelerated comps in an increasingly volatile macro environment and feel implied Q4 revenue guidance will prove very conservative.â Binettiâs new price target implies a 19% upside for LULU.LULUâs analyst consensus is a Moderate Buy, derived from 17 buys and 9 holds set in the last three months. The $205 average price target suggests a 3.3% upside from the current share price of $198. Dollar General Corporation (DG)The increased tariff tensions between the US and China are making life hard for retailers, but Dollar General (DG â Get Report) has shown that even heavily impacted retailers can cope. The company is a highly profitable discount retailer with a strong presence in rural areas. It sees over $25 billion in annual revenues.Like Lululemon, Dollar General is gaining on a strong second quarter. The companyâs Q2 earnings, released on August 29, showed a 10% EPS beat and an 8.4% year-over-year revenue gain. The final numbers were $1.74 in EPS, based on $6.98 billion in revenues. DG shares gained over 10% immediately after the earnings report, fitting for the fourth quarter in a row of above-forecast revenues.The post-earnings gains put DGâs 30-day gain at 16.5%. The companyâs year-to-date gain is 44.3%. Momentum is clearly on Dollar Generalâs side going into the fall. Investors and analysts are clearly confident in the companyâs ability to continue performing.Barclayâs Karen Short showed her upbeat view by raising her price target on DG to from $141 to $180. She wrote, âThe company beat a high Q2 bar with a strong beat and raise, underscoring its industry leading execution and positioning in the dollar space.â Her new price target implies an upside potential of 15.3%.From KeyBanc, Bradley Thomas also set a $180 price target. His comments on the stock are detailed and upbeat: âDG remains one of our top picks, positioning investors for growth and defensiveness. 2Q EPS was ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected sales, gross margin, and expense leverage. Management raised 2019 guidance, even considering elevated tariffs. We remain positive on the near-term and long-term opportunity ahead for DG, supported by generally consistent execution, numerous initiatives to drive growth, and managementâs long-term focus.âOverall, DG holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 15 recent buys and 3 holds. Shares are selling for $157 and the average price target of $168 suggests room for 7.1% upside.Visit the Trending Stocks tool now, and see what else the Streetâs top analysts are talking about.This author is long on AAPL.",2019-09-12,223.085,218.75,-4.335,-0.019432055,Don't move,14,98,1287,126,9.79020979020979

555,1143,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-war-spurs-china-technology-210000939.html?.tsrc=rss,The Trade War Spurs Chinaâs Technology Innovators Into Overdrive,2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.In Shenzhenâs glitzy financial district, a five-year-old outfit creates a 360-degree sports camera that goes on to win awards and draw comparisons to GoPro Inc. Elsewhere in the Pearl River Delta, a niche design house is competing with the worldâs best headphone makers. And in the capital Beijing, a little-known startup becomes one of the biggest purveyors of smartwatches on the planet.Insta360, SIVGA and Huami join drone maker DJI Technology Co. among a wave of startups that are dismantling the decades-old image of China as a clone factory â and adding to Washingtonâs concerns about its fast-ascending international rival. Within the worldâs No. 2 economy, Trumpâs campaign to contain Chinaâs rise is in fact spurring its burgeoning tech sector to accelerate design and invention.The threat they pose is one of unmatchable geography: by bringing design expertise and innovation to the place where devices are manufactured, these companies are able to develop products faster and more cheaply.âNinety percent of the worldâs headphones are produced in China, 90% of Chinaâs headphones are produced in Guangdong, and 90% of Guangdongâs headphones are made in Dongguan,â explains SIVGA co-founder and product chief Zhou Jian, an 18-year audio industry veteran who has done work for global brands like Sennheiser Electronic GmbH & Co., Sony and Bose. His company is based in Dongguan because, he says, âDongguanâs industrial chain is near perfect.â Zhou estimates there are hundreds of specialist factories in the area focusing on a particular component, such as screws, and his network of contacts among those suppliers has been invaluable. It was âsupport from these good friendsâ that got SIVGA, short for Sound Impression Via Genuine Artwork, off the ground.Now employing more than 30 people and offering a premium brand called Sendy Audio, SIVGA sells a luxury pair of $599 headphones called Aiva. Featuring handcrafted wooden ear cups and intricately detailed metal grilles, the Aiva have shipped more than 2,000 units into a niche, high-margin market thatâs usually reserved for U.S. boutique outfits like Audeze and Campfire Audio. âAs far as we know, we are the only company in Dongguan with a woodworking department,â Zhou says, while also pointing out that at SIVGA âthe development time is short and many decisions can be made on the spot.â This instant design responsiveness is a signature feature of Chinaâs new tech upstarts, and Zhou sums it up with an old Chinese proverb: âsmall boats change course easier than big boats.âDJI is the pioneer that proved Chinese tech companies could aspire to be more than just manufacturing contractors or fast copiers. âDJI leads the industry with features like automatically avoiding obstacles in flight, which it implemented first,â notes Techsponential lead analyst Avi Greengart. âRivals in the U.S., France and Taiwan have not been able to catch up.â DJIâs lead is based on the same geographic synergies as SIVGAâs. When a U.S. rival suffers a manufacturing hitch or defect, its ability to identify and react to the problem is hampered by the distance between its designers and manufacturers. DJI doesnât have that problem, which has helped propel it to being the top drone maker in the world.âThese are Chinese companies that want to be industry leaders and innovators. DJI and Insta360 are perfect examples of that movement,â says Anshel Sag, mobile industry analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy. âA big part of it comes from the entrepreneurial spirit of Shenzhen.âLike Dongguan, which this year saw a large new Huawei Technologies Co. campus open, Shenzhen is a nexus of component makers and suppliers eager to find new customers for their wares. The cacophonous Huaqiangbei bazaar in the city exhibits a wild array of gadgets from smartphone-electric shaver hybrids to neon-lit unicycles with Bluetooth speakers. That commoditized fray offers inspiration but also an impetus to rise above it with genuine innovation. The successful companies are the ones who make the most of the rabid production and iteration around them.âIn Shenzhen, thereâs a well-established supply chain system,â says Insta360 founder Liu Jingkang. âFrom a research perspective, in-house R&D may only contribute 60% of a product, the rest needs to be finished in factories.â The CEO of OnePlus, another company based in the city, has expressed pride in its ability to prototype new devices at great speed because heâs just a 45-minute drive away from its assembly lines.Even without being Apple Inc., Chinese companies are now building world-class, premium products, though Chinaâs signature feature of undercutting the established market remains. Whether or not a Chinese company is first to a technology, it makes sure to be first to a breakthrough price.Backed by Xiaomi Corp. in 2014, Huami is responsible for creating the massively popular Xiaomi Mi Band, which has flooded the China market at a $20 price. The Mi Band offers most of the features of a Fitbit fitness tracker â including step counting and heart-rate monitoring â at a fraction of the cost. After expanding to sales in the U.S. and launching its own Amazfit brand, Huami is now shipping in excess of 5 million devices per quarter, and its chief executive talks openly about âtaking outâ at least some of its larger rivals, including Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.âThe operating models for Garmin and other European and U.S. smart device vendors are flawed. Their retail price is very high,â Huami CEO and founder Wang Huang says. âYou will only be able to sell very expensive products to a very small group of customers because mainstream and lower-end markets will be eroded by companies like us.âEvidence for the Huami chiefâs words abounds in the smartphone market, where the top group of manufacturers is increasingly dominated by Chinese names like Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei. 2018 saw these brands make major inroads into the European market, relying on better pricing and faster feature introductions. Xiaomi âconsistently produces budget flagship phones with first-to-market implementations,â says Techsponentialâs Greengart. Along with SIVGA, Huami and Insta360, theyâre following in the footsteps of companies like Lenovo Group Ltd., which was among Chinaâs early breakout successes after buying IBM Corp.âs PC business in 2004. Their global ambitions and innovation pose a serious threat to the leadership of a plethora of U.S. tech products in areas from design to functionality, whether they be GoPro cameras, Apple iPhones or HP laptops.Chinaâs rapidly rising tech creators are not without commercial savvy. Many of them are planning to seek capital on Shanghaiâs new trading venue for startups, locally known as the Star board. Ninebot Inc., the Xiaomi-backed outfit that acquired Segway in 2015, aims to raise $300 million there. In unicorn territory, the Google-backed Mobvoi, which creates natural language translation algorithms for its Wear OS smartwatches, is also said to be seeking a high-value listing on the Star market.Royole, the startup that earned a measure of notoriety by beating Samsung to selling the worldâs first foldable device in 2019, has managed to secure a deal with Louis Vuitton that will see the two companies putting flexible screens on handbags of the future. Like Huami initially leaning on the Xiaomi brand to build itself up, Royole stands a chance to be a luxury goods player with the help of a bigger company. The differences between Californiaâs Silicon Valley startups, which have tended to do a better job of marketing and deal-making, and Chinaâs new generation of homegrown businesses are gradually disappearing.How and Why the U.S. Says China Steals Technology: QuickTakeAmerican critics, such as President Donald Trump, commonly point to a track record of Chinese companies copying features from abroad, and one of their bits of evidence is the way Appleâs iPhone software and design seem to be habitually recreated by Huawei, Xiaomi and others. Thereâs not much that a Western company can do in such situations. When Segway filed a complaint against a number of Chinese brands for IP violations, it ended up conceding the fight and getting acquired by one of its defendants.The observable change now is that a new generation of innovative companies arenât waiting for someone else to show them the blueprint. Chinaâs rapid ascent in innovation goes beyond anecdotal evidence from startups like DJI and Huami, and the countryâs corporations now rank among the worldâs most prolific patent applicants.âThe trend of China moving to high-end manufacturing, research and design is unstoppable,â said Jia Mo, a Shanghai-based analyst with consultancy Canalys.To contact the reporters on this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.net;Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Vlad Savov, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-12,223.085,218.75,-4.335,-0.019432055,Don't move,11,35,1450,57,3.9310344827586206
556,1144,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foxconn-billionaire-clears-path-taiwan-091939066.html?.tsrc=rss,Foxconn Billionaire Clears Path for Taiwan Presidential Run,2019-09-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group, threatened to throw Taiwanâs presidential race into turmoil as he took a key step toward running as an independent.Gou withdrew Thursday from the opposition Kuomintang, a necessary precursor to mounting a third-party challenge against President Tsai Ing-wen. The move came despite a last-minute plea from senior KMT leaders including Tsaiâs predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, for Gou to back their nominee and help return the China-friendly party to power. Gou has until Tuesday to apply to run in the Jan. 11 election.âI know Iâm doing the right thing, something major that will turn around Taiwanâs destiny,â Gou said in a statement. Gouâs candidacy would shake-up Taiwanâs political landscape, undercut KMT challenger Han Kuo-yuâs effort to unseat Tsai and potentially weaken both dominant parties. A three-way race could be a hard-fought affair, with Tsai leading with 33.7% of support, compared with 28.9% for Han and 25.6% for Gou, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Apple Daily newspaper.Since both Gou and Han support closer ties with China -- always Taiwanâs most contentious wedge issue -- the Foxconn founder could complicate the KMTâs bid to oust Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Tsai has been dogged by an increasingly assertive Beijing, which has been angered by her refusal to accept the Communist Partyâs bottom line that both sides belong to âone China.ââThe KMT will be substantially impacted by Gouâs declaration to run,â said Stephen Tan, president of the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Policy Association. âAlthough Gou will run as an independent, his constituents have been mainly the âblueâ voters and the moderates whom KMT is working hard to seek for support.âTaiwanâs Tsai Rises From Ashes With a Hand From Hong KongGou has continued to publicly flirt with the idea of a presidential bid despite losing the KMT primary to Han in July. The firebrand Kaohsiung mayor has become one the islandâs best-known -- and most divisive -- political leaders since his surprise win in the DPPâs southern stronghold in November.Han said he regretted Gouâs move to withdraw from the KMT. Ma, the former president, and KMT Chairman Wu Den-yih were among several senior opposition figures who published advertisements in newspapers earlier Thursday urging Gou to support their nominee.Gou built Foxconn from a maker of television knobs into a global powerhouse that is now Appleâs biggest supplier and Chinaâs largest private employer. He also has ties to President Donald Trump, meeting the U.S. leader at the White House in May, weeks before stepping down as chairman of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconnâs main listed arm.Shares in companies Gou controls rose after he quit the party Thursday, with FIH Mobile Ltd. surging more than 15% in Hong Kong and the group flagship Hon Hai rising 2% in Taipei.Hong Kong Immigration to Taiwan Surges as Protests Grind OnGou has been sending signals that he might mount an independent run for weeks, although heâll still need to collect around 280,000 signatures to get on the ballot. After assembling a campaign team, he confirmed last month that he was considering breaking from the KMT for a stand-alone bid.âThis conservative, hidebound party leadership is putting their own interests ahead of their partyâs and the partyâs interests ahead of the nationâs,â Gouâs spokesman, Evelyn Tsai, told reporters Thursday. âMr. Gou wonât miss this party.â(Updates with Gou quote in third paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Adela Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Samson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, ;John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, Karen LeighFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-12,223.085,218.75,-4.335,-0.019432055,Don't move,2,8,607,12,1.9769357495881383

566,1167,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-grappled-months-over-disclosure-224444499.html?.tsrc=rss,Oracle Grappled for Months Over Disclosure of CEO Hurdâs Illness,2019-09-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. said Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd is taking a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons, disclosing the move along with quarterly earnings on Wednesday afternoon.The software company made the announcement a day earlier than the results were scheduled to be released, after Bloomberg News contacted Oracle in relation to a story about the executiveâs health.The company grappled for more than a year with one of the most harrowing dilemmas a corporation can face: when â and whether â to disclose a serious illness that has befallen a senior executive.Hurd, one of the companyâs two CEOs, is struggling with an illness that has occasionally taken him in and out of the public eye for more than a year, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Managementâs rationale for staying silent until now centered at least in part on the depth of Oracleâs leadership bench, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing an issue the company considers private.Hurd, 62, shares the CEO title with Safra Catz, 57, a well-regarded 20-year company veteran, who previously served as finance chief and still oversees Oracleâs accounting, operations, legal and corporate development. Larry Ellison, the companyâs septuagenarian co-founder, handed over the CEO reins five years ago, but has never strayed far from the helm. He chairs the board, orchestrates management changes and remains deeply involved in product oversight through his role as chief technology officer. Catz and Ellison will assume Hurdâs responsibilities during his leave of absence.Even so, Hurdâs well-being is hardly inconsequential to Oracleâs business. The usually outgoing executive oversees sales, regularly meeting with big corporate customers who spend tens of millions of dollars on Oracleâs collection of software programs. Of the three top executives, heâs also the most media-friendly, frequently outlining the companyâs vision in meetings with the press and on television.But over the past year and a half, Hurd has curtailed public appearances and the company has taken pains to squelch discussion of his health. Late last year, Oracle downsized his responsibilities, placing most of the marketing team under Ellison, people familiar with the matter said. Bloomberg News initially contacted Oracle concerning this story on Tuesday. The company declined to comment or make any executives available. It made the announcement Wednesday, with no warning, along with first-quarter earnings, which were scheduled to be released Thursday afternoon.Securities law can be unclear about when a company is obligated to disclose a CEOâs ill health, allowing some to hold out as long as possible, while others have erred on the side of speaking out early. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasnât settled the question, but in general says shareholders should be told about âmaterialâ matters, defined as issues on which âthere is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important.â The U.S. Supreme Court set a similar standard in a 1988 decision.Apple Inc. gave scant and often delayed details on the cancer that took the life of its co-founder and former CEO, Steve Jobs, in 2011. More recently, some companies have been quicker to tell investors and the public about executive illnesses. That was the case with banking leaders Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Lloyd Blankfein, of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who were both treated for cancer while serving as CEO.âThe default position for a company whenever any senior executive is facing health issues should be to disclose, because it is something investors need to know when they assess a company,â said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law Schoolâs program on corporate governance. âIt may not be an issue if thereâs a strong board, a strong succession plan, and strong investor confidence in the company. But when itâs a company such as Oracle where you really have a long history of shareholders not having confidence in issues around executive pay, for instance, itâs that much more important for them to know whatâs going on.âHurd and Catz have been navigating Oracle through a critical time, with sales growing modestly since they became CEOs in 2014 and still hovering at just under $40 billion a year. Oracle has been blindsided by the success of cloud software entrants like Amazon.com Inc., and has been racing to catch up and woo new customers. For more than a year, Oracle has conducted layoffs and reorganizations in various business units. On Wednesday, the company reported that fiscal first-quarter revenue was little changed, trailing analystsâ projections.Oracleâs financial performance has been mixed in the past two years. Sales have been choppy, with applications revenue gaining, server-computer sales falling and lucrative maintenance fees stagnant. Still, the shares have climbed more than 24% since the start of the year on optimism that Oracleâs cloud-based programs have started driving overall growth. Some investors say theyâre confident in senior management despite some speculation over the last year that Hurd was unwell. C.T. Fitzpatrick, the founder of Oracle investor Vulcan Value Partners, described Hurdâs health as a ânon-issueâ and said the CEO seemed fine when on stage last year. âThereâs a deep bench there and a lot of talent in that organization,â Fitzpatrick said. âI think that Safra in her own right has a lot of bandwidth.âAt Oracleâs headquarters south of San Francisco in Redwood City, California, Hurdâs illness has been a topic of quiet discussion among employees for at least a year and a half. There have been periods over the past two years when he has missed many meetings and become a rare sight on campus, including about a month of canceled appointments and appearances in spring 2018, people familiar with the matter said. He has also been missing from headquarters recently, separate people said.The company and Hurdâs representatives have given various explanations for his absences. In spring 2018, Hurd was traveling to New York on a private plane when he started feeling ill. The jet turned around and Hurd canceled his appearance at a Bloomberg Live event. Oracle said the executive had a stomach-related illness. When she was Oracleâs chief marketing officer, Judy Sim gave employees a variety of reasons for why the CEO missed events or appeared to be ill. Sim, who is now Hurdâs chief of staff, has said that he was battling the flu and on separate occasions that a hernia was responsible for his changing appearance, including weight loss and hair that appeared to be a toupee, people familiar with the matter said. At one stage in 2018, a person close to Hurd said he was suffering from a blood-related ailment.There have also been rumblings about Hurdâs condition among the financial analysts who study Oracle on behalf of clients. Their opinions vary, from viewing his health as a private matter to wanting Oracle to be more forthcoming. âPeople would like to know. Sometimes more information is good,â Jack Andrews, an analyst at Needham & Co., said in an interview. âThe lack of transparency and clarity is a cultural thing at Oracle probably set at the top by Larry Ellison. Would it be nice to have that clarity? Yes.â At the same time, Andrews sees Hurd as less âintegralâ to Oracleâs fortunes than Ellison or Catz.Though Ellison, 75, shifted some of Hurdâs responsibilities in the past year, Hurd had retained management of Oracleâs sales organization, industry-based software groups, one marketing team with a narrow product focus, press relations and investor relations, people familiar with the matter said. Itâs not clear what role, if any, Hurdâs health played in the decision to shuffle oversight of marketing, and Ellison asserted control over that group at a time when he thought his companyâs brand image had languished, the people said. Another person said the changes were unrelated to Hurdâs health. Ellison tasked his chief of staff, Mamei Sun, with a skunkworks project on how to rebrand Oracle in the summer of last year, people familiar with the matter said. Early this year, he formally appointed Sun to take over branding. He also hired Rupal Shah Hollenbeck, a former sales and marketing executive at Intel Corp., to bring a new perspective to the marketing team, the people said.Hollenbeck and Sun report directly to Ellison. All of Oracleâs top executives still have to go to the chairman to make major decisions, so Ellison remains an irreplaceable force at the software maker â the tiebreaker, the kingmaker, the companyâs living charter.While some of Hurdâs responsibilities had been reassigned, Oracle has taken steps that effectively would protect his image inside and outside the company. The software maker recently required executives to complete an online training that instructed them they arenât permitted to discuss any executive or employee health matters, a person familiar with the matter said.&#92;--With assistance from Tom Giles and Ashlee Vance.To contact the reporter on this story: Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Emily BiusoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-10,216.7,223.59,6.89,0.031795107999999996,Buy,4,35,1485,43,2.8956228956228958

Today's leadership came by way of the technology and healthcare sectors, the two largest sector weights in the S&P 500, with some contributions from the defensive, high-yielding utilities group.Source: Shutterstock President Donald Trump took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), something that doesn't always end well for investors, to encourage the Federal Reserve to take interest rates to zero or even negative. It's unlikely the Fed follows the advice of going to negative rates, at least not anytime soon, but another rate cut does appear imminent if Fed funds futures are to be believed.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Adding to today's ebullience was news out of China that the country will exempt certain U.S. goods from 25% tariffs that were deployed last year. This is the latest sign that the trade talks the two countries are expected to hold next month could actually happen and that the results could be positive.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose catalysts were enough to send the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.06% while the S&P 500 gained 0.72%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.85%. Much of the strength in the blue chip index was attributable to its larger components as, in late trading, just 16 of the Dow's 30 residents were trading to the upside. Boeing Triumphs AgainTry as I might to mention different Dow names from day-to-day, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is the index's largest component and when it's the best-performing Dow stock on a given day, as it was Wednesday, it bears mentioning.The aerospace and defense giant rallied 3.50% today after CEO Dennis Muilenberg made some positive though not earth-shattering comments about Boeing's efforts to get the 737 MAX jet back in the skies.&quot;We're continuing to make solid progress on return to service,&quot; said the CEO at an investor conference in California. &quot;We're actively engaged with regulators around the world and day-to-day working with the FAA on return-to-service timing.&quot; AAPL Stock Hits $1 Trillion AgainA day after its new product launch event, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) performed better than it did yesterday, gaining 3.18% to rank as the second-best Dow performer behind Boeing, pushing the stock back into the exclusive $1 trillion market value club for the first time this year. Predictably, analysts were chatty about Apple stock today following news of iPhone enhancements and that the Apple + streaming service will be less expensive, at least for now, than competing options.Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated her &quot;strong buy&quot; rating on Apple stock while boosting her price target to $250 from $225, implying upside of more than 10% from Wednesday's close. Encouraging SignAs noted earlier, the healthcare sector was a big contributor the broader market's Wednesday upside and three of the Dow's four healthcare names traded higher today with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) being the only offender of the quartet.Granted, it's just one day, but it's nice to see some strength in the pharmaceuticals stocks because this group could face more headwinds as the 2020 presidential campaign unfolds. With that in mind, House Democrats are looking for ways cobble together a plan that would alter how Medicare pays for drugs while President Trump has and will continue to tout falling drug prices.While brand name prices are still increasing, the president can lean on declining generic prices in what is sure to be a hot-button campaign issue. This is a bipartisan issue, rare as those are, and that presents some risks going forward. Bottom Line in Dow Jones TodayI recently mentioned signs that value stocks are making a comeback against their growth rivals. Some market observers may overstate the consequences in that scenario. It's not all bad when considering decent percentages of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are classified as value stocks.What would be positive for the sustainability of this mini-rally is strength in maligned small caps and that scenario is emerging. The Russell 2000 Index jumped more than 2% and that could be a sign stocks are poised to defy usually gloomy September expectations. Importantly, that index came into Wednesday with a gain of almost 5% over the past week.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

It also topped the 0.9% rally in the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ).The IWM is now up almost 5% just this week, easily topping the roughly 50 basis appreciation in the S&P 500. The ETF has also seen a few strong days of accumulation, causing some to wonder whether small caps are set to start closing that gap.While the IWM may be coming into some possible resistance, continued momentum could kick-start a breakout. Movers in the Stock Market TodayShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) barreled to their highest level in about a year, rising 3.2% to $223.59. The move comes on a two-fold catalyst. First, the company introduced its new iPhone and other products set to launch over the next few weeks.

She squeezed huge penalties out of Apple Inc. and Google, rousing wrathful tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump. Washingtonâs ire only raised her own profile, making her a close-run candidate to head the EU commission and landing her with a potentially powerful role as vice president in charge of digital policy.Silicon Valley firms probably have the sense of âbetter the devil you knowâ when they see Vestager return for another five years, said Pablo Ibanez Colomo, a law professor at the London School of Economics. âThey know pretty much where she comes from and know her styleâ of strict enforcement.While the Dane dealt coolly with criticism, claiming she didnât deliberately target tech companies for antitrust and tax cases, she often shied away from attempts to settle investigations without fines. Being resolute won her admiration but also sparked irritation in Paris and Berlin when she blocked the Siemens AG and Alstom SA rail deal they favored. Sheâs spent the last few months trying to sell herself as a politician prepared to act on fears that Europe is being left behind by China and the U.S., especially on technology.One of her first acts after taking office in 2014 was to start up a stalled Google investigation that her predecessor had come under fire for trying to settle. The Alphabet Inc. unit had to hand over 8.2 billion euros ($9.1 billion) in fines for three probes, make changes that saw it start charging for its Android phone software in Europe and alter shopping ads. It still faces the risk of more fines from fresh investigations and complaints it isnât complying with existing antitrust orders.Vestagerâs new post lets her move beyond the limits of antitrust enforcement, often criticized for ordering too few changes too late to help less powerful rivals. Sheâs paid close attention to how internet platforms host smaller companies they also compete with, an issue for Amazon.com Inc. in a probe the EU opened in July and also the subject of complaints targeting Apple Inc. and Google.Her work is ânot an attack on businesses, this is an attempt for democracy to shape our society,â she told reporters on Tuesday. She described her new role as helping to plug gaps identified by antitrust investigations, pointing to recent rules that allow small companies to get answers from internet platforms if they think they are being treated unfairly. The measures appear to target issues raised by the EUâs Google probes.âThat is a kind of regulation that you might see more of,â she said. âWe had the insight from the specific cases but that insight will also lead you to consider more regulation.âVestager will take over as digital chief at a time when the European Commission is coordinating the blocâs 5G security, grappling with what role Huawei Technologies Co. should play in the build-out of the infrastructure, as the U.S. urges Europe to block the Chinese telecom giant in spite of the risks posed by angering an important trade partner.Franceâs Sylvie Goulard, picked as internal market commissioner, will work more directly on defining standards for 5G mobile and next-generation networks, cybersecurity rules and response strategies, along with leading industrial and defense policy.Von der Leyen told Vestager to coordinate work on an EU approach on the ethical implications of AI within the first 100 days of the mandate and look at ways to share non-personal big data. She must also coordinate work to find international agreement on a tax on digital companies by the end of 2020 or to propose a fair European levy. And to deal with fears that China unfairly undercuts European firms, she has been told to tackle the distortion of foreign state ownership and subsidies.Vestager and other commission nominees face hearings in early October at the European Parliament before lawmakers vote on their posts.âShe will be very positively seen and sheâs intelligent and smart enoughâ to win over lawmakers, said Andreas Schwab, a German member of the parliament.(Adds comments from law professor and Vestager starting in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Lyubov Pronina.To contact the reporters on this story: Aoife White in Brussels at awhite62@bloomberg.net;Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Peter ChapmanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-10,216.7,223.59,6.89,0.031795107999999996,Buy,2,7,802,11,1.3715710723192018
597,1198,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-dividends-reliable-investment-133333787.html?.tsrc=rss,3 Tech Dividends for a Reliable Investment Income,2019-09-10,"With interest rates falling, and dragging bond yields down with them, investors are seeking reliable sources of steady income. Itâs a move that naturally draws them toward dividend stocks, but historically, the search for dividends has not drawn investors into tech. That has changed in recent years, as the tech giants have been offering better rewards for shareholders.A little history will help. The tech industry feeds on growth, growth, growth â and so developed a habit of quickly reinvesting cash and profits into R&D and acquisitions. In the traditional tech view, paying dividends was a negative signal, that the company did not have an exciting initiative in which to invest. Growth would attract investors.But in the last ten years, there has been a slow shift. Tech companies, especially the giants that lead the industry, have increased dividend payouts by 17%. Last year saw them return $88 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Apple and Microsoft led the way, paying back a combined $27 billion to their investors in 2018. Weâve used TipRanks' Top Stocks page to find out which companies the best analysts are bullish on. Apple, Inc. (AAPL)From its small beginnings in Steve Jobsâ parentsâ garage, Apple has grown to be one of the worldâs largest companies. Last summer it was the first publicly traded company to break above a $1 trillion market cap, and its popular iPhone series has over 900 million installed users worldwide. The downturn in the final quarter last year, along with the ongoing maturation of the smartphone market replacement cycle, hit the company hard, and its share price fell 38% from its October 2018 peak to its trough on January 3.Apple has rolled with the changing fiscal and product environments by shifting its emphasis to services and user base monetization. The companyâs share appreciation this year â it is up 35% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500âs 18% gain â is a sign that investors are confident in its ability to compensate for reduced iPhone revenues going forward.Investors are confident, and Apple is rewarding them. The company resumed dividend payments in 2012, after a 17-year break, and quickly became a favorite with dividend investors. The yield is modest, at just 1.44%, but the high share price puts the current payment at $3.08 annually. And better, from an investorâs perspective, the company has committed to maintaining the dividend and has increased the payment more than 10% over the past five years.Looking forward, Apple is bullish ahead of todayâs iPhone 11 launch event. The new smartphone devices are expected to show incremental improvements overall, and to fit in well with the current lineup. The new Apple Watch, however, is expected to show new features, including health monitoring apps, that are expected to put it in the spotlight. This is in line with the companyâs shift from the iPhone to its other divisions. Wearables showed a record revenue increase in the last quarterly report.Writing from JPMorgan, analyst Samik Chatterjee says, âThe key watch points for tomorrow's event will revolve around 2019 iPhone pricing, and announcements around other hardware products which have more opportunity to surprise relative to expectations.â He gives AAPL a $243 price target, with a 13% upside.5-star analyst Timothy Arcuri, of UBS, agrees that Apple will stick to meeting expectations in todayâs event. âWe expect Apple to announce three new iPhones and a new Watch. The iPhone models are very similar to current models save for some general performance improvement and a materially better camera with more functionality. Overall, the Watch seems like more of a potential upside surprise given new health features.â Arcuriâs $235 target implies an upside of 10% for the stock.Overall, AAPL keeps a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus. This is based on 16 buys, 11 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months. AAPL shares are selling for $214, with an average price target of $226, giving a potential upside of 5%. The current share price is only 6% lower than the companyâs all-time peak of $228, reached in October 2018. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)While Apple was first to reach $1 trillion in market cap, and Amazon (AMZN) was second, Microsoft has been the one to hold its value at that level. The software company first broke the trillion-dollar level in April of this year, and remained above ever since. The companyâs current market cap is $1.046 trillion.Building its success on the ubiquitous Windows operating system and its more recent move into cloud-based services, Microsoft offers income-minded investors the best of all worlds. Share price has consistently gained over the past fourteen years, and the company has simultaneously adjusted its dividend to steadily increase over the same time. The 1.34% yield is well below the S&Pâs average of 2%, and the $1.84 annual payout wonât turn any heads, but it has developed a reputation for rock-solid reliability.Top market analysts agree that Microsoft has stable upward momentum. From Mizuho Securities, Gregg Moskowitz writes, âMSFT hasn't seen a slowdown in demand, usage trends or pipeline, other than some regional volatility in China. Data center trends continue to be strong, and management remains relatively optimistic about the PC demand environment over the next year or two.â His price target, $152, implies an upside of 10%.KeyBancâs Brent Bracelin is also bullish on MSFT. He notes especially that the company has just locked down a $7.6 billion contract with the US Department of Defense, to provide Office software for the Pentagon. He says, âWe view some of these broader government modernization plans and cloud initiatives as another growth vector for Microsoftâs commercial cloud segment.â Bracelin gives MSFT a price target of $155, for a 12% upside.Microsoftâs Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 buys, along with 1 hold and 1 sell. MSFT shares sell for $137 and have an average price target of $153, giving the stock an upside potential of 11%. Like Apple, Microsoft shares are up 35% year-to-date. Broadcom, Inc. (AVGO)By revenue, Broadcom is the sixth-ranked semiconductor company in the world by sales revenues, bringing in $18.46 billion in 2018. The company weathered last yearâs Q4 downturn better than most tech companies, along with this past summerâs volatility. At the same time, Broadcomâs sales growth has been slower than some of its competitors â Intelâs growth from 2017 to 2018 was 14%, while Broadcomâs was just 4%.Still, the company has held onto its relative position in its industry, and in recent weeks has seen a 7.3% jump share prices. Shares are closing in on $300, and this brings Broadcomâs biggest investor advantage into sharp relief: the company believes in rewarding shareholders. The dividend is already 3.62%, well above the S&P average, and is scheduled for an increase later this year. Factoring in the high share price, AVGO pays out $10.60 per share per year, giving this stock the one-two combination of high yield and high payout.Mark Lipacis, of Jefferies, notes the companyâs plans to increase the dividend, and expects to see a boost of 30% in December. He points out that this is in line with the Broadcomâs general policy of returning half of the annual free cash flow to the shareholders. Calculating from the fiscal year 2019 FCF estimate of $10.9 billion Lipacis expects the dividend to hit $13.72 annualized, which would put the yield at an impressive 4.9%. His dividend expectations make him naturally bullish on the stock, reflected in his $324 price target and 10% upside.Loop Capitalâs Cody Acree is also bullish on AVGO, based on the companyâs broader prospects. He sets a $310 price target and writes, âWe expect the company to maintain its cautious stance regarding its channel and OEM inventory trends along with expressing concern over the direction of end-market demand as a result of the macro-related uncertainties. We see Broadcom returning to sequential and annual growth in Q4â¦â His target implies an upside of 6%.Broadcom maintains a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, with 22 buy ratings and 8 holds. Shares are selling for $293, and have an average price target of $312. The upside potential is 6.7%.Visit TipRankâs Analystsâ Top Stocks page, and find out what other companies the Streetâs best analysts are looking at now.",2019-09-10,216.7,223.59,6.89,0.031795107999999996,Buy,20,97,1365,137,10.036630036630036

Sheâs been handed the same job in Ursula von der Leyenâs proposed European Commission.Lest it be seen as some kind of consolation prize for missing out on the top job of president (which went toÂ von der Leyen),Â Vestager has also been awarded the title of executive vice president in charge of coordinating the blocâs digital strategy. Thatâs a huge job that goes beyond market abuse and into standard-setting on data protection, AI ethicsÂ and mobile networks.Itâs a wiseÂ appointmentÂ that will please those who see the fight against the monopolizing powers of Silicon Valley and Seattle as being at the heart of any sensible European technology strategy.Â Vestager herself says the two issues of who gets to own our data and fair competition must go hand in hand, something that will spook those who were hoping for a more pliant approach from Brussels.Her hard line has caused plenty of anguish across the Atlantic, infuriatingÂ U.S. President Donald Trump in particular. The EUâs probes range across Googleâs job search, Facebookâs cryptocurrency project Libra, and how Amazon.com Inc.Â treats its vendors.The reappointment is also a strong message to Vestagerâs many critics inside the EU, includingÂ the French and German politicians whose favored merger of the train businesses of Alstom SA and Siemens AG was blocked by Brussels this year on competition grounds.Â She has proven admirably able to resist pressure from EU member statesÂ to bend her merger rules. She should be able to do so again.With a bit of luck, Vestager will be able to overcome some of the possible contradictions in her role. Her remit will include both regulating the worst excesses of the U.S.-dominated tech sector while encouraging more tech investment into the EU, much of it from American funds. This might mean, for example, beefing up Europeâs data-protection laws, such as its relatively new GDPR rules, even though intense lobbying from business has made the first implementation a mixed bag in terms of fines imposed. Vestagerâs Liberal colleague Sylvie Goulard has become the EUâs internal market commissioner, which may help smooth any wrinkles.Ironically, for all the talk of Europe doubling down on its anti-Big Tech crusade with Vestagerâs reappointment, this might be the point at which the EU and the U.S. finally find common cause on technology policy. After years of inaction, American authorities are falling over themselves to investigate the likes of Facebook and Google, and the U.S. presidential election campaign will probably feel the pressure from Democratic Party candidates.Given the global nature of these problems âÂ Facebookâs Libra has triggered a worldwide pushbackÂ from central banks and politicians â itâsÂ  a good thing that American regulatorsÂ have a seasoned campaigner to talk to in Brussels.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

614,1313,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-foxconn-broke-chinese-labor-014501429.html?.tsrc=rss,"Apple, Foxconn Broke a Chinese Labor Law to Build Latest iPhones",2019-09-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and manufacturing partner Foxconn violated a Chinese labor rule by using too many temporary staff in the worldâs largest iPhone factory, the companies confirmed following a report that also alleged harsh working conditions.The claims came from China Labor Watch, which issued the report ahead of an Apple event on Tuesday to announce new iPhones. The non-profit advocacy group investigates conditions in Chinese factories, and says it has uncovered other alleged labor rights violations by Apple partners in the past.For its latest report, CLW said undercover investigators worked in Foxconnâs Zhengzhou plant in China, including one who was employed there for four years. One of the main findings: Temporary staff, known as dispatch workers, made up about 50% the workforce in August. Chinese labor law stipulates a maximum of 10%, CLW noted.Apple said that, after conducting an investigation, it found the âpercentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standardsâ and that it is âworking closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.â It added that when it finds issues, it works with suppliers to âtake immediate corrective action.â Foxconn Technology Group also confirmed the dispatch worker violation following an operational review.Appleâs supply chain has faced criticism over poor labor standards for years, and the company has pushed manufacturing partners to improve factory conditions or risk losing business. However, suppliers and assemblers are always trying to churn out more handsets. Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., hires tens of thousands of temporary workers to ramp up production and meet iPhone demand during the key holiday season each year.âOur recent findings on working conditions at Zhengzhou Foxconn highlights several issues which are in violation of Appleâs own code of conduct,â CLW wrote in its report. âApple has the responsibility and capacity to make fundamental improvements to the working conditions along its supply chain, however, Apple is now transferring costs from the trade war through their suppliers to workers and profiting from the exploitation of Chinese workers.âCLW was founded in 2000 as a 501(c)(3) organization to investigate Chinese factories that make toys, shoes, electronics and other products for some of the worldâs largest multinational companies. It has an office in New York City and one in Shenzhen that offers a hotline for factory workers in China, according to its website.While its report said 55% of factory staff were dispatch workers in 2018, and about 50% in August, this included student interns. Because many of these students returned to school at the end of August, that number is now closer to 30%, which is still a violation, according to CLW.âWe believe everyone in our supply chain should be treated with dignity and respect,â Apple also said in a statement. âTo make sure our high standards are being adhered to, we have robust management systems in place beginning with training on workplace rights, on-site worker interviews, anonymous grievance channels and ongoing audits.âFoxconn said it found âevidence that the use of dispatch workers and the number of hours of overtime work carried out by employees, which we have confirmed was always voluntary, was not consistent with company guidelines.âIt added that its âwork to address the issues identified in our Zhengzhou facility continues and we will closely monitor the situation. We will not hesitate to take any additional steps that might be required to meet the high standards we set for our operations.âApple releases an annual supplier responsibility report that details working conditions in its supply chain. In its latest report, Apple said it conducted 44,000 interviews with supplier employees last year to check if they were properly trained and knew how to voice concerns, while taking new steps to prevent forced labor.In late 2017, Apple found Foxconn had employed high school students who worked illegal overtime to assemble the iPhone X. Apple sent specialists to the facility to work with management on systems that ensured appropriate standards were followed.Foxconn is the largest of a coterie of gadget assemblers that produce most of the worldâs consumer electronics from sprawling Chinese bases. Typically operating on wafer-thin margins, they employ millions of mostly migrant and temporary workers because activity tends to wax and wane with shopping seasons and fluctuations in demand.Dispatch workers donât receive benefits that full-time employees get, such as paid sick leave, paid vacations and social insurance, which provides medical, unemployment and pension coverage, according to CLW. While base wages can be higher for dispatch workers, they are paid by third-party firms on a short-term basis and are not employed directly by Foxconn, CLW says. Dispatch workers can become official factory workers after an initial three-month period, according to the groupâs report.Last month, Foxconn said it fired two executives at one of its Chinese plants after another CLW investigation found the company was relying heavily on temporary workers and teenage interns to assemble Amazon.com Inc. Echo speakers. Foxconn reviewed the Hengyang facility and found the proportion of contract workers and student interns had on occasion exceeded legal thresholds, and that some interns had been allowed to work overtime or nights.The group, which also monitors conditions in myriad industries from apparel to retail, has run reports in the past on suppliers to the likes of Nike Inc. and Adidas AG and, recently, probed a factory that manufactured Ivanka Trump-branded shoes.Apple and Foxconn seek to produce about 12,000 iPhones per shift at the Zhengzhou factory, CLWâs latest report found. Last yearâs iPhone XS models were more complex to build than the iPhone X, requiring more workers, the group also said.According to emails seen by Bloomberg, Apple told CLW in August that it was looking into the findings and had questions about the report. The company sent an investigator to the factory and met with Foxconn officials to discuss the heavy use of dispatch workers, but Apple and Foxconn are still allowing the activity despite violating the 10% standard, CLW said.The CLW report also detailed other findings, such as:During peak production periods, resignations are not approved.Some dispatch workers have not received promised bonuses.Student workers do overtime during peak production season, even though regulations on student internships prohibit this.Some workers put in at least 100 overtime hours each month, during busy production periods. Chinese labor law limits monthly overtime to 36 hours.Workers must get approval to not do overtime. If requests are denied and staff still choose not to work overtime, they are admonished by managers and miss out on future overtime opportunities.Workers sometimes have to stay at the factory for unpaid meetings at night.The factory doesnât provide adequate protective equipment for staff.Work injuries are not reported by the factory, and verbal abuse is common there.While overtime is allegedly often required, most workers want to work overtime to make more money, according to an anonymous diary written by a CLW investigator in the factory.âWe looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false,â Apple said. âWe have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor.âApple added that less than 1% of workers were student workers, and that a small percentage of them voluntarily worked overtime or night shifts. Apple and Foxconn both said this issue has been corrected.Most factory workers are paid about 4,000 yuan ($562) a month, one CLW investigator found. After taxes and mandatory fees, they get roughly 3,000 yuan a month, according to the CLW report.Chinaâs per capita disposable income was 28,228 yuan in 2018, or 2,352 yuan a month, China Daily reported earlier this year, citing government data.(Updates with detail on the group from the 7th paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Edwin ChanFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-09,214.17,216.7,2.53,0.011813046,Don't move,17,31,1311,65,4.958047292143402

Google stock has failed to gain traction over the last year. Despite double-digit profit growth, lawsuits and privacy concerns have left Alphabet stock unable to gain traction.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com To be sure, the company continues to innovate. Although it still derives the majority of its revenue from ads, many of its outside ventures look poised to drive growth. However, this has failed to translate into gains for GOOGL stock. As long as GOOGL continues to struggle with the ever-increasing number of data privacy breaches and lawsuits, Alphabet stock will suffer along with it. Alphabet Struggles Despite InnovationsInvestors have become the most prominent victims of these accusations. The most recent example of this failure to gain traction came after a 9.6% one-day surge following its last earnings report. The current GOOGL stock price stands at just over $1,200 per share, about the same price where it traded this time last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market I have criticized Alphabet in recent articles for locking up the value of its various companies. Many point to Waymo, Google's self-driving car unit. Estimates of the value of Waymo by itself have reached as high as $250 billion. Alphabet overall supports a value of $837 billion. It makes little sense for Waymo to make up 30% of the company's value when 86.4% of company revenue comes from ads.Both I and others have also suggested using some of its $121 billion cash hoard to pay a dividend. I do not think the promise of $25 billion in stock buybacks has benefitted investors as much as dividend payments would.However, despite my criticisms of the company, it will likely remain an excellent long-term investment. As our own Luke Lango states, Alphabet stock serves as the backbone of the internet and also offers what he calls &quot;tangential growth drivers,&quot; such as Waymo. GOOGL, Legal Scrutiny and Lower MultiplesStill, in the short-term, it faces challenges. These obstacles have become serious and will probably hamper the stock for the foreseeable future.As most know, Alphabet faces an antitrust probe from the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also fined the company $170 million for breaching the privacy of children. However, the Washington Post now says that more than half of state attorneys general will pursue separate antitrust suits against Alphabet.Many have become wary of the power of Silicon Valley. Consequently, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also face antitrust scrutiny.No doubt this has weighed on Alphabet. The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio now stands at around 21. This comes in well below the average PE ratio of about 34.2 that the stock has seen over the last five years. Estimated profit growth of 11.6% this year and 14.4% in fiscal 2020 indicates that GOOGL stock trades near its fair value. A Rescue Plan for Alphabet stockThe lawsuits and accusations of privacy breaches likely explain why the premium has disappeared. However, these actions only make it more critical that Alphabet unlocks more of its value.The irony is Google locks up so much of its value that a forced breakup would probably boost the various equities that now comprise Alphabet. The sum of the parts would become so much larger than the whole.Barring that, spinoffs could motivate traders to buy more stock. The company has long served as a wellspring of innovation. It needs some of these innovations to bring profit growth as competition heats up in the ad market. With the lawsuits, it also needs revenue sources less dependent on data privacy.As I have stated in the past, they could also pay a dividend. The company has tried to help investors through buybacks. However, removing shares from the market does not necessarily result in higher stock prices. The dividend returns cash to investors. It also makes GOOGL stock attractive to income investors who have eschewed the equity.The company will get past these lawsuits one way or the other. However, if they got past this issue in the marketplace rather than the courtroom, it would better serve holders of Alphabet stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

AMZN stock is up 420% over the past five years, and nearly 20% so far in 2019. However, there's some ground to make up before AMZN hits the trillion dollar market cap level again, a rarified club the company was in last September and then briefly again this July.Source: Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.com To hit $1 trillion again, Amazon stock would need to surpass the $2,000 level. Most analysts have a price target on AMZN well above $2,000. But an RBC analyst is making headlines for his call that the rollout of one-day Prime shipping is going to cause AMZN stock to hit $2,600 over the next year.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market How realistic is this assessment? Could the move to next-day free Prime shipping really propel Amazon stock to 45% growth over the next 12 months?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips RBC's Bull Case for AMZN StockOver the weekend, RBC Capital Markets' Mark Mahaney released a note to investors in which he extolled the boost that the move to next-day Prime shipping is expected to have on Amazon's bottom line (via CNBC):&quot;We believe AMZN may well generate accelerating revenue & unit growth for some time as One-Day goes nationwide & worldwide.&quot;According to his model, the move to improve the current two-day free Prime shipping to one-day (announced in April) will drive increased membership in Amazon Prime. In addition, the prospect of getting most of their purchases the next day will increase the amount of spending per household. Mahaney predicts the combined effect could boost Amazon's revenue 7% to 15%, and as a result he's raised his estimates for AMZN revenue in 2020 to $337 billion.Based on that math, RBC raised its 12-month price target on Amazon stock from $2,250 a share (the current median AMZN stock price target) to $2,600 a share. With Amazon currently trading around $1,800 that would represent 12-month growth for AMZN stock of 45%. There Are a Few Hurdles to Overcomeâ¦Amazon has proven itself capable of implementing big changes on a massive scale and in minimal time. The company has invested $800 million this year in infrastructure upgrades to support next day Prime delivery. But there are a few hurdles that Amazon will have to overcome if it's going to hit the kind of numbers RBC is looking for.Naturally, Amazon's competitors aren't sitting still. Shortly after AMZN announced the planned upgrade for Prime shipping, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said it would offer free one-day delivery on 220,000 items to 75% of the country by the end of this year.The U.S. Department of Justice is currently investigating FANG stocks -- which includes AMZN -- for signs of practices that may have stifled competition and hurt consumers. This is unlikely to result in a breakup of Amazon, but the investigations could be a drag on AMZN stock.The ongoing trade war with China could prove more troublesome. The latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods will see prices rise on many items Amazon carries. If the situation continues to escalate, consumers could begin cutting back on spending -- despite being able to receive their online purchases faster than ever.Finally, there's a possibility the one-day delivery plan itself could come under attack. A recent article accusing Amazon of hooking Americans on fast delivery while using third party delivery drivers to avoid responsibility for deadly crashes has been raising tough questions.  Can AMZN Do It?The phenomenal growth of Amazon, and the resulting performance of Amazon stock, leaves no doubt that the company is capable of implementing change rapidly and at a massive scale. It also leaves no doubt that consumers respond to AMZN's big moves.Along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon is one of very few companies that has achieved a trillion dollar market cap, even if it was briefly. If there's anything that seems likely to push AMZN back into that club -- and keep it there -- it's the move to one-day Prime shipping.  * Dorian's Impact on the Markets But we'll have to wait another year to see if RBC made the right call in predicting AMZN stock will rocket past that lofty level, and hit $2,600.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It's a specialized, high-tech company that has been caught in the middle of two forces, causing volatility in MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com As a result, after topping $61 last June -- its highest close in nearly two decades -- MU dropped to half of that as 2018 came to an end. This year, Micron stock has seen plenty of volatility. But since the end of June, MU has been making a steady recovery. It's now up over 45% from the start of the year after hitting $45.27 at the end of August.The question is, does Micron stock have further upside, or has its performance in 2019 reached its zenith? Looking at the two factors that have had such an impact on MU since last year's rapid decline will help in making that call.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stabilization of World Memory Prices Set to Strengthen MU StockMicron's primary business is the production of computer memory and storage: DRAM, NAND flash memory and USB drives that use flash memory. It's one of only a few companies that dominate the global market, along with two South Korean competitors: Samsung and SK Hynix.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now When times are good, this is a highly profitable business. However, the market for computer memory products is cyclical. This has had a profound effect on Micron stock over the past several years.In 2017, demand for memory products like DRAM was sky high. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other smartphone manufacturers hadn't yet seen the era of declining sales. Moreover, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google were bulking up data centers. At the height of this cycle of robust demand, prices for DRAM, NAND flash memory and related products were up. And in June 2018, MU stock hit $61.39, its highest close since 2000 when it approached the $100 level.However, the demand for DRAM and NAND memory quickly turned into a glut. That left producers like Micron with excess inventory, cutting into prices. Between that high in June to the end of 2018, Micron stock dropped 48%.That has been the reality for memory producers through 2019. But a recent report published in Digitimes suggests that the worst of the glut may be over. Further, global memory prices are set to begin stabilizing. If that turns out to be true, MU stock at $45 has significant upside. The China FactorThe second big factor that has affected all tech stocks in 2019 is the U.S.-China trade war. Micron is particularly vulnerable to the ups and downs of the tariffs, threats of tariffs and the U.S. penalization of China's Huawei. In fact, Micron has said that Huawei alone accounted for 13% of its revenue for the first half of fiscal 2019.The escalation of the trade war with China through May and June battered MU stock. Besides the threat of a ban against selling products to Huawei, the prospect of consumer electronics like the iPhone facing rising costs because of tariffs -- a move that would likely cut further into sales and slash demand for DRAM and NAND -- made for a rough and volatile month of trading for MU.We've seen that trade war volatility in play once again over the past month, with ramped up tensions between the U.S. and China and additional tariffs. Is There Still Upside for Micron Stock?If predictions are correct that data center demand for DRAM is due to pick up, then MU stock should be positioned for further growth -- it's still $15 off the levels it hit last June. The wild card is the trade war.It could still play spoiler if tariffs are increased. But the big hit to Micron's bottom line from the loss of Huawei's business is already baked into the valuation of MU stock. If that were to ease up, the upside would be considerable.At this point, of the 24 analysts surveyed by Nasdaq, half have Micron rated as a &quot;strong buy.&quot; That suggests there's confidence that MU does indeed have room to grow in 2019 and 2020.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.The tech sector endured some pretty tough times last year. Even Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled.But if we put these troubles aside for a moment and focus on the longer-term outlook, a different picture emerges. Stretching out to 2025, some of these big-name tech stocks begin to look very attractive indeed -- especially at their current price levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn order to pinpoint which tech stocks will be leading the way seven years from now, I turned to a recent report from RBC Capital. Its &quot;Imagine 2025&quot; portfolio selects the tech stocks the firm believes will be winning on a long-term basis. &quot;We believe the following names are best positioned to outperform over a seven-year time horizon through 2025,&quot; writes the firm.What does this mean for now? It means longer-term investors should think twice before selling the stocks listed below, while other investors may want to keep a close eye on the following stocks as potential buy on the dip opportunities.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy Here are the top tech stocks primed to outperform over the next few years: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Shutterstock As I said above, Alphabet has not been immune to the market's choppiness but that doesn't mean it's still not one of the top stocks to buy.At the end of the day, this is still a killer stock pick with a &quot;strong buy&quot; analyst consensus on TipRanks. This is with a $1,346 average analyst price target.&quot;AMZN and GOOGL, in particular, appear to have invested the most in AI competencies and have the Big Data access and Compute Power infrastructure to benefit most from AI and ML developments,&quot; writes RBC Capital.And Google has an extra string on its bow: its self-driving car unit Waymo. Alphabet disclosed that Waymo reached the 10 million miles of autonomous vehicle driving milestone.&quot;GOOGL appears particularly well situated to lead autonomous vehicle innovations, given its substantial investments in Waymo autonomous vehicle technology,&quot; it said.Luckily for Alphabet, RBC believes autonomous vehicles will be arguably one of the biggest applications of AI.Interested in GOOGL stock?

Nvidia (NVDA)Source: Shutterstock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pushing the boundaries of technology and this should pay off over the years to come.Even though Nvidia is suffering over the last six months, the long-term picture remains very compelling making this one of the top stocks to buy and hold.For example, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis (Track Record & Ratings) calls the January quarter a setback. However, he says Nvidia remains &quot;a top play on secular themes&quot; in AI, gaming and autonomous vehicles. He tells investors to &quot;buy the confession.&quot;  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now &quot;While there are no guarantees of a winner in the AI race, we think Nvidia is well ahead of its peers and is continuing to gain traction due primarily to the value of Cuda software,&quot; says RBC Capital. It estimates over one million engineers working with Cuda and calls it &quot;the secret sauce that underlies the entire ecosystem.&quot; Get the NVDA Stock Research Report. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Atomic Taco Via FlickrYou probably aren't surprised to see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on this list. The eCommerce company is consistently innovating for the future, be it through acquisitions, technology or entering new markets.One interesting advancement for the company is in the field of robotics. &quot;Amazon appears particularly well situated to lead robotics innovations, given its ongoing investment in Kiva logistics robots,&quot; points out RBC Capital.The company already deploys something to the tune of 100K Kiva robots, basically a robot army. And it's now looking increasingly likely that a very large percentage of Amazon's distribution workforce will be complemented with these robots by 2025.As RBC concludes, the impact of this should be greater operational efficiency for AMZN stock.Another interesting trend to consider when you're looking at tech stocks to buy: AI-powered Voice Recognition will likely improve significantly from current levels, allowing even better use of internet apps via voice commands. Again, Amazon should be a major beneficiary of this trend.Notably, AMZN boasts one of the best ratings on the Street. This comes with a $2,215 average analyst price target. Get the AMZN Stock Research Report. Rapid7 (RPD)Source: Shutterstock If you are looking for cheaper long-term stocks to buy, look no further than Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD). This company uses a unique data- and analytics-driven approach to cybersecurity.The stock is highlighted by RBC as an attractive name in the cybersecurity space, particularly following the recent acquisition of Komand. The company snapped up Komand in 2017 to boost its security orchestration and automation offering.&quot;The need for well-designed security and IT automation solutions is acute; resources are scarce, environments are becoming more complex, all while threats are increasing,&quot; says Corey Thomas, CEO of Rapid7.&quot;Security and IT solutions must evolve through context-driven automation, allowing cybersecurity and IT professionals to focus on more strategic activities.&quot;  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Plus RBC's Matthew Hedberg (Track Record & Ratings) is behind the stock. &quot;Success has continued to highlight the power of the platform approach with impressive cross-sell metrics driven by combining security and IT Ops&quot; concludes the analyst. Get the RPD Stock Research Report. Splunk (SPLK)Source:  Web Summit Via Flickr&quot;Within our software universe, we would highlight Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) as a likely winner in the big data category,&quot; writes RBC Capital.Splunk basically turns machine data into answers. It produces software for searching, monitoring and analyzing machine-generated big data, via a web-style interface.In part, these answers are generated through the firm's machine learning system. Splunk provides the Machine Learning Toolkit, a guided workbench to create and test flexible models that can handle any use case.&quot;A key value of creating models in Splunk is that users can seamlessly apply them to real-time machine data&quot; says RBC Capital.Plus RBC isn't the only firm singing the stock's praises. This &quot;strong buy&quot; stock has a $155 average analyst price target. Get the SPLK Stock Research Report. PayPal (PYPL)Source: Shutterstock If we turn to financial tech stocks to buy, analysts are upbeat on&quot;moderate buy&quot; stock PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) right now. This is with a $1117 average analyst price target.First of all, PayPal offers massive scale. And second, it boasts a unique two-sided model among tech stocks, with both consumers and merchants onside. This means the company can control the entire consumer experience.&quot;PayPal's unique assets enable the company to tap into the long-term global shift to digital commerce&quot; says RBC Capital.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Plus the firm sees the company as a champion of democratizing finance around the globe. &quot;We believe its growing platform of assets will open up the ~2B people around the world who lack financial services.&quot;Similarly top Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene (Track Record & Ratings) notes PYPL's &quot;unique&quot; competitive position. He is even more confident in the stock following recent partnerships, and anticipates high-teens revenue growth and 20%-plus EPS growth for the next several years. Get the PYPL Stock Research Report. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock RBC Capital sees a long runway for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.&quot;We think AAPL could be a major beneficiary of AI and VR/AR-related trends, which could generate significant tailwinds for its services business,&quot; it writes. It notes that the latest iPhones are equipped with the ability to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from experiences.What's even more interesting is that by 2025 we could be looking at the first real &quot;iPhone generation.&quot; 2025 is 18 years from the launch of the first iPhone.For people who grew up with iOS devices, Apple could have data on every app a person installed, on every flight, book and purchase, as well as academic records, health statistics, family background and more.Now imagine an AI trained on this data set. &quot;This AI would truly be a 'personal' assistant. A hyper-customized neural network that would be so powerful, it would make an existing services pool very strong and usher in a host of new offerings that can only be imagined&quot; says the firm. Get the AAPL Stock Research Report. Synopsys (SNPS)Source: Shutterstock That makes this one of the best stocks to buy in the chip sector is that it is pretty much a guaranteed winner of future tech trends. Someone needs to design AI chips and that someone is Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS).Synopsys is essentially an &quot;arms dealer&quot; for AI and all things chip related says RBC Capital.&quot;By helping design complex chips, Synopsys is in the thick of AI in terms of design,&quot; the firm writes. And the best part is that it doesn't even matter what new companies come along they will still need Synopsys.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects &quot;As new and existing companies continue to push the edge of technology, Synopsys will be helping the companies design each chip regardless of it being a GPU, CPU, FPGA, Digital Chip, Analog chip or otherwise&quot; the firm explains.Even now, the stock looks bullish with a &quot;strong buy&quot; analyst consensus and $109 average analyst price target. Get the SNPS Stock Research Report. Micron (MU)Source: Shutterstock One of the great secondary chip stocks to buy is Micron (NASDAQ:MU). All future trends result in data creation and Micron is perfectly positioned for this with its DRAM/NAND memory portfolio.&quot;The incredible amount of data generated by AI, AR/VR and autonomous driving would require significantly higher memory, both NAND and DRAM, leading to strong and long-term tailwinds for MU&quot; writes RBC Capital.Plus we could be looking at a compelling entry point. Indeed, Deutsche Bank's Sidney Ho (Track Record & Ratings) points out that shares appear cheaper right now. He has just reiterated his &quot;buy&quot; rating with a $60 price target.And the tech stock still retains its &quot;moderate buy&quot; analyst consensus rating. This is with a $54 price target. Get the MU Stock Research Report. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Last but not least, make sure to make room for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is a company that ticks all the boxes when it comes to the best stocks to buy for future trends&quot;Leading hyperscale hybrid cloud platform with big runway of growth in AI, IoT, Gaming and other services&quot; explains RBC on the stock's inclusion in its 2025 portfolio.Like GOOGL and AMZN, MSFT stock benefits from 1) massive amounts of raw compute power; 2) large data sets; and 3) ability to hire the smartest data scientists on the planet.It picks Microsoft as the No. 1 AI company in the public cloud space. This is thanks to the company's rapidly growing Azure cloud platform.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More &quot;We believe Microsoft is in an enviable position vs other public cloud competitors as their customers can also leverage AI and ML capabilities on premise, something [Amazon's] AWS and [Google's] GCP can't deliver natively,&quot; said RBC Capital.Also note the stock's killer &quot;strong buy&quot; rating with 20 out of 21 analysts bullish on the stocks prospects. Top this off with a $142 average analyst price target for upside of 17% and I would say Microsoft is one of the most appealing tech stocks to buy and hold onto!

668,1431,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tomtom-maps-revamp-bet-self-053000204.html?.tsrc=rss,TomTom Maps Out Revamp With Bet on Self-Driving Cars,2019-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Once a household name for its satellite navigation for cars, TomTom NV has taken a backseat in recent years as smartphones, loaded with apps like Google maps, surged in popularity.Now the Dutch digital mapping company is betting that your car needs directions more than you do. Over the past few years, TomTom has been building high-definition or âdynamicâ maps for self-driving cars. Itâs a decision that could help it challenge tech platforms, like Alphabet Inc.âs Google, as cars are increasingly sold with more autonomous capabilities.âWe used to make maps for humans, but now we make maps for robots,â Alain De Taeye, member of TomTomâs management board, said at a journalist briefing in Amsterdam.TomTomâs share price peaked in 2007 at around 100 euros a share. But this summit coincided with the launch of the iPhone. A year later, TomTom reported sales of more than 12 million personal navigation devices, itâs record high. By 2011, it announced a restructuring program that included forced lay-offs to counter lower sales and in 2017, TomTom took a 169 million-euro write down on its consumer unit. Itâs share price has since hovered at around 20 euros.TomTom now finds itself with several deep-pocketed rivals battling for the future of car navigation, including Apple Inc., Google and HERE Technologies, the digital mapping company controlled by BMW AG and other German car makers. In a blow for TomTom, longtime partner Renault SA and associates Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. last year signed on with Googleâs Android operating system to supply standard-definition maps.On a quest to claw its way back, TomTom is ditching unwanted business lines, like the Telematics fleet-management business, and doubling down on HD maps. TomTom says itâs been able to differentiate itself from competitors on HD maps by being independent and not having an advertising-based business model like Googleâs.In addition to sensors and other features, HD maps are an important part of autonomous driving, which can incorporate different levels of human assistance â from very little to none whatsoever in even the harshest weather conditions.HD maps, stored on a carâs computer system, replicate every lane, guard-rail, road edge and pole that a vehicle sees, helping cars locate their positions within centimeters. Those features are critical to avoid crashing into nearby cars, but they also help the car discern which traffic light at a busy cross-section it should obey or identify a speed sign hidden by a truck.So far, TomTom has publicly announced HD partnerships with Baidu Inc. on its Apollo driverless project, and with Renault on the carmakerâs SYMBIOZ autonomous driving program. It announced in March that it had won multiple deals to provide HD maps to major car makers, but declined to say which ones. Those contracts, which typically last more than 10 years because of ongoing service needs, have so far resulted in a roughly 60% market share in HD maps for TomTom, according to Willem Strijbosch, the companyâs head of autonomous driving.âNot every car maker has made their decision yet on who will support them on HD maps,â said Strijbosch. âBut out of all the car makers that have made a decision, we see that the big ones â the top 10 â are picking TomTom.âTomTom collects traffic and road data on more than 67 million kilometers around the world using 600 million different devices â including its mobile mapping cars, sat navs, and mobile phones. Of those roads, TomTom has so far covered only 400,000 kilometers in HD. Its HD maps are currently only available on highways in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South Korea and Japan but it is working to add more side roads as the technology advances.The mapping firm doesnât disclose revenue from HD maps but in July it boosted its full-year guidance, saying it now expects sales from its location technology to grow 17% to 435 million euros, up from 430 million euros forecast in April. That amounts to around two-thirds of the groupâs overall expected revenue.âThe single biggest risk to the TomTom investment case is costs,â said Wim Gille, head of equity research at ABN AMRO. He said the company still has lots of ground to cover on HD maps compared to its standard definition maps and clients will want reassurance that the company can continue to serve them in a decade from now.While HERE is out-earning TomTom in revenues, Gille said, itâs also spending around 1 billion euros a year in operating expenses, about twice as much as TomTom. Still, he said both companies have what it takes to build and maintain an HD map.âThe market is big enough for both of them,â he said.To contact the reporter on this story: Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels at ndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-04,209.19,213.28,4.09,0.019551604,Don't move,2,25,807,29,3.593556381660471

Everyone was buying a desktop, and then a laptop, and the companies that supplied them could do no wrong.Then came the smartphone. We all know to blame Apple Inc. for the end of the PC era. Though Steve Jobs didnât invent the âphone + internetâ mash-up, the iPhone spurred competitors to make such devices useful and customers took to them with glee. A decade-long smartphone boom followed.Take a look at the recent share price performance of handset makers and thereâs not much left to be gleeful about. As handsets got boring, so too did the shares of the companies that relied on them for revenue. HTC Corp. and Xiaomi Corp., two of the few firms left that focus on handsets, have seen their shares plummet in the past year. PC makers, on the other hand, have been a little more exciting.Yet if you divide the universe of smartphone and PC makers in two, youâll discover something interesting: Those that primarily focus on corporate customersÂ or lead the market in a key non-consumer businessÂ are outperforming those that get a larger slice of revenue fromÂ smartphones andÂ consumer PCs.Â Since Dec. 21, when Dell Technologies Inc.Â started trading again after a take-private deal in 2013,Â its shares jumped 21%. International Business Machines Corp., Samsung Electronics Co.Â and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. have all climbed since that date.Â (2)Â By contrast, LG Electronics Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., HTC, HP Inc., Acer Inc.Â and Xiaomi all dropped.Â Â The first major outlier is Apple. I suspect thatâs because fund managers sitting on piles of cash realized that it probably makes sense to put money into companies with fatÂ margins and a cult following, even if itâs lost a little luster. ZTE Corp. also did well, but thatâs mostly because itâs recovering from being at the wrong end of U.S. national-security policy.Instead of looking at PCs versusÂ smartphones, a paradigm that worked well for around a decade, the better way for investors to divide the technology-hardware sector isÂ consumer and enterprise. The two HPs â Enterprise and Inc. âÂ serveÂ as the perfect example. HP Inc. gets 60% of its revenue from desktop and notebook PCs, while HP Enterprise sells servers, storageÂ and networking services. HP Enterprise is up 10% while HP Inc. fell 7% over the period. IBM is up 22%, Acer is down 13% and Xiaomi has fallen 36%.Â The lines do get a little blurred. Lenovo, for example,Â is alsoÂ in the server and smartphone businesses, and DellÂ gets around 11% of its revenue from consumer PCs.Â Having divided their investible universe along these new fault lines, however,Â punters would be foolish to believe that the bull-run in enterprise will continue unabated. Both HPE and Dell last week raised their full-year earnings forecast, spurring shares to rise. In reality, that bottom-line strength appears to come from better margins and cost control rather than a rosier outlook for revenue.Â âWeâve tried to position the company to be successful in anyÂ economic environment,âÂ Dell CFO Tom Sweet told Bloomberg News. That kind of attitude deserves the 10% single-day spurtÂ the stock received. But cost control can only go so far. If a global economic slowdown and the trade war donât abate, then not even fiscal pragmatism can save earnings.Sell-side analysts are adjusting accordingly. Theyâve trimmed most companiesâ 2019 revenue forecasts over the past six months, as well as next yearâs EPS estimates.By examining more closely the end-market and customer base for each company, investors will find it easier to sort likely winners from losers. In the face of even bigger problems for the economy, however, a new analytic framework wonât change the fact that tough times are still ahead.(1) That's when Dell shares started trading. The rise/fall divide since that date is somewhat coincidental, but the wider point still stands: Enterprise has largely outperformed consumer.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

681,1444,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-borrowing-7-billion-194006473.html?.tsrc=rss,Why Apple IsÂ Borrowing $7 Billion While Sitting onÂ a $200 BillionÂ Cash Pile,2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., one of the most cash-rich companies in the world, is still looking to get a piece of the ultra-cheap money thatâs up for grabs in the bond market.With investment-grade bond yields hovering near record lows, itâs tempting even for Apple -- with more than $200 billion of cash and investment securities on its books -- to see what investors will lend it. Turns out that number is $7 billion, or just over 3% of its current coffers.With the 30-year Treasury at record lows, many companies have been able to borrow more cheaply for much longer. Apple will pay around 2.99% interest on its new 30-year bonds, compared with the 3.45% itâs paying on three-decade bonds it sold in 2015. On a $1.5 billion issue, that equates to savings of nearly $7 million of interest annually, or more than $200 million over the course of three decades.Todayâs debt sale could help Apple refinance roughly $2 billion of debt thatâs scheduled to mature this year in addition to much of the $10 billion it has coming due in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The borrowing is profitable for the companyâs shareholders by at least one measure: the companyâs earnings yield, a measure of how much the company earns relative to its share price, is around 5.6%, while it can borrow for 30 years for less than 3%.Appleâs not the only one seizing this golden opportunity. A record 21 U.S. investment-grade companies tapped the market Tuesday, borrowing a combined $27 billion. With more than a dozen deals in the works Wednesday, this weekâs issuance is already set to hit $54 billion, comfortably surpassing dealer estimates of $40 billion.(Updates with earnings yield in paragraph four.)&#92;--With assistance from Luke Kawa.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Allan Lopez, Dan WilchinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-03,205.7,209.19,3.49,0.016966456,Don't move,4,18,330,26,7.878787878787878

687,1450,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-pay-170-million-youtube-131601012.html?.tsrc=rss,Google to Pay $170 Million for YouTube Child Privacy Breaches,2019-09-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Googleâs YouTube agreed on Wednesday to pay a $170 million fine and limit ads on kidsâ videos to settle claims that the company violated childrenâs privacy laws.The worldâs largest video-sharing site agreed to pay the fine, which is a record for a childrenâs privacy case, of $136 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and $34 million New York State for failing to obtain parental consent in collecting data on kids under the age of 13, the FTC said.Starting in four months, Google also will limit data collection and turn off commenting on videos aimed at kids, YouTube announced at the same time, moves that will hamstring its ability to sell advertisements against a massive portion of its media library.The settlement under the 1998 Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, represents the most significant U.S. enforcement action against a big technology company in at least five years over its practices involving minors. Washington is stepping up privacy and antitrust scrutiny of the big internet platforms that have largely operated with few regulatory constraints.âThe $170 million total monetary judgment is almost 30 times higher than the largest civil penalty previously imposed under COPPA,â FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a joint statement with fellow Republican Commissioner Christine Wilson. âThis significant judgment will get the attention of platforms, content providers, and the public.âThe commissionâs two Democrats broke from its three Republicans, however, saying the settlement did not go far enough to fix the problems. Consumer groups and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Wednesday slammed the fine as an insufficient deterrent, given the size of the company.âItâs extremely disappointing that the FTC isnât requiring more substantive changes or doing more to hold Google accountable for harming children through years of illegal data collection,â said Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, which helped lead the complaints that led to the settlement. In a statement, Golin did praise a likely decrease in targeted ads aimed at kids.Googleâs shares rose 1.1% in New York.YouTube said it will rely on both machine learning and video creators themselves to identify what content is aimed at children. The algorithms will look at cues such as kidsâ characters and toys, although the identification of youth content can be tricky. Content creators are being given four months to adjust before changes take effect, the company said.The company will also spend more to promote its kids app and establish a $100 million fund, disbursed over three years, âdedicated to the creation of thoughtful, original childrenâs content,â Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki wrote in a blog posting.âTodayâs changes will allow us to better protect kids and families on YouTube,â Wojcicki wrote in the blog, which acknowledged the rising chances that children are watching the site alone. âIn the coming months, weâll share details on how weâre rethinking our overall approach to kids and families, including a dedicated kids experience on YouTube,â she said.YouTube has already begun plans to strip videos aimed at kids of âtargetedâ ads, which rely on information such as web-browsing cookies, Bloomberg has reported. The company violated COPPA with data collection to serve these ads, the FTC alleged. Some consumer advocates including Golin and the Center for Digital Democracy say the move away from targeted ads would do little to stop tracking of kids when they watch content aimed at general audiences, and that relying on video creators to make the changes could hurt compliance.Cracking DownâGoogle made billions off the backs of children, developing a host of intrusive and manipulative marketing practices that take advantage of their developmental vulnerabilities,â said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Washington-based non-profit Center for Digital Democracy. He added that the deal announced Wednesday âsends a signal that if you are a politically powerful corporation, you do not have to fear any serious financial consequences when you break the law.âThe FTC has been cracking down on firms that violate COPPA. It fined the popular teen app now known as TikTok $5.7 million in February to resolve claims the video service failed to obtain parental consent before collecting names, email addresses and other information from children under 13. The agency is also planning to revamp its rules around childrenâs online privacy.Alphabet Inc.âs Google doesnât break out sales for the video site, but the company has reported that YouTube is its second-largest source of revenue behind search advertising. Research firm Loup Ventures estimates that 5% of YouTubeâs annual revenue, or roughly $750 million a year, comes from content aimed at children.YouTube had long maintained that children under 13 donât use its site without parental supervision, as its terms of service stipulate, but according to the FTC, it touted young users in advertising materials. Thereâs ample evidence these young viewers flock to the site, and the consumer groups complained.âSends a SignalâThe site has already made tweaks as it tries to create a safer destination for children. In recent months, it changed its algorithm to promote what it called âqualityâ kidsâ videos, a shift that alarmed many of its video creators. Wojcicki said the newest transitions âwonât be easy for some creatorsâ and the company would work with them and provide resources to navigate the changes.âThis decree will slash the advertising revenue that supports video creators producing high-quality child-friendly content,â said Steve DelBianco, president and chief executive officer of NetChoice, a tech lobbying group that counts Google as a member. âThis means far fewer ad dollars to support videos that my teenager watches to learn about nutrition, sports instruction, and science projects.âThe company also introduced more parental controls for YouTube Kids, the app it launched in 2015 to offer a smaller selection of YouTubeâs massive library, and created a web version of the app. The service is far smaller than YouTubeâs primary audience of more than two billion monthly visitors, and data show the main site is used by more children than the kids app.Read more: YouTube Is Considering Changes to Kids Content After CriticismDemocratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who was a key force behind the passage of COPPA, said in a statement that the settlement âlet Google off the hook with a drop-in-the-bucket fine and a set of new requirements that fall well short of what is needed to turn YouTube into a safe and healthy place for kids.âMarkey said the deal should have required that Google delete all kidsâ data and prohibited the company from launching new kidsâ services without the approval of independent experts. Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has proposed a COPPA update with Markey, tweeted that the fine is âpaltry.â Democratic Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is leading a House committee antitrust probe of the technology industry, called it the âfriends and family treatmentâ and said âthe seriousness of this misconduct cries out for a serious penaltyâ such as punishment aimed at specific executives.The Justice Department, which typically reviews cases involving civil penalties, didnât act on it and returned it to the FTC to file, according to Andrew Smith, head of the commissionâs consumer protection bureau, who declined to say why. A Justice Department official who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters confirmed that the agency declined to pursue it without elaborating. The Justice Department is scrutinizing Googleâs digital advertising and search operations, Bloomberg has reported.Google isnât the only big internet platform facing pressure for its practices with minors. Childrenâs advocacy organizations have filed complaints with the FTC accusing Facebook Inc. of tricking children into making purchases while playing games on the social network. The company recently disclosed it has discussed its childrenâs chat app with the FTC, although itâs not clear whether there was a formal probe. Kids advocates have also alleged that Amazon.com Inc.âs Echo kids smart speaker violates privacy law.Other tech giants and Google have faced fines over their practices involving children before. In 2014, Google agreed to refund at least $19 million to settle with the FTC for failing to get parental consent for charges racked up by children playing games on mobile devices. Apple Inc. also agreed in 2014 to refund at least $32.5 million and change its billing practices after similar complaints. Yelp Inc. previously said it paid $450,000 for allegations it failed to test the age-registration feature on its applications and collecting names and email addresses from children as young as 9 years old without the consent of their parents.Google could also still face additional legal exposure from other states, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the Democratic FTC commissioners, suggested in her dissent to Wednesdayâs settlement.âMore action is needed, and I hope that our partners in state attorneysâ general offices can finish the job,â she wrote.(Updates with reaction from sixth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Chris Strohm, David McLaughlin and Gerrit De Vynck.To contact the reporters on this story: Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net;Mark Bergen in San Francisco at mbergen10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-03,205.7,209.19,3.49,0.016966456,Don't move,1,18,1506,20,1.3280212483399734

Stocks rallied, buoyed by some geopolitical relief.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam withdrew the controversial extradition plan that served as the tipping point of pro-democracy protests that spanned several months. Ebbing of tensions in Hong Kong could clear the way for Beijing to proceed with meaningful efforts to negotiate a trade truce with the U.S., which would really light a fire under a nascent rally.The encouraging news from overseas comes ahead of comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later this week and the August jobs report due out Friday. Overall, today was a good start toward healing the wounds incurred by stocks yesterday and last month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Nasdaq Composite added 1.3% while the S&P 500 jumped 1.08%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.91%. In late trading, 24 of the 30 members of the Dow were trading higher. Technology LeadershipThere has been plenty of talk about semiconductor stocks lately, due in large part to the group being one of the &quot;ground zeros&quot; for the U.S./China trade war. On that note, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the Dow's best-performing name today, adding 4.1%. Even with the trade war far from being resolved, there may be reasons for investors to revisit semiconductor stocks as some analysts see upside for the group over the rest of 2019.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy &quot;We remain confident in a [second-half] pickup in overall demand with near seasonal demand in PC computing, wireless/wired infrastructure (around 5G), aerospace/defense, smartphones (ex-Huawei), consumer/gaming, and a resumption in cloud/hyperscale spending trends,&quot; said JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur in a note out earlier today.Tech bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) got in on the act, gaining 1.7%. The company announced a $7 billion corporate bond offering today, its first since 2017. Investors need not worry about debt issues because Apple carries more than $200 billion in cash on its balance sheet and less than half that figure in liabilities.Some positive analyst commentary also boosted shares of Apple today, with Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani talking about the iPhone maker's compelling opportunity set in India.&quot;Apple has spent years lobbying for both changes and the ongoing effort by the Indian government to attract foreign companies should help Apple expand its customer base in the fast growing country,&quot; said the analyst. Exxon ExcellenceIt has been a while since I've been able to say &quot;excellence&quot; in the same sentence as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). Not-so-fun fact: the largest U.S. oil company recently dropped out of the top 10 names in the cap-weighted S&P 500 for the first time.In better news, the stock gained more than 1% today after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate said Wall Street isn't fully appreciating Exxon's cash flow generating capabilities. He has $100 price target on the shares, implying upside of 45% from current levels. Another WinnerBoeing (NYSE:BA) -- the largest member of the Dow and one that is off 20% from its 52-week high, putting in a bear market -- posted a modest gain today. Some traders argue that the worst of the bad news (and there has been plenty) is priced into Boeing stock and upside is the path of least resistance from here.

But with opposition parties saying they wonât back him, because they donât trust him to keep his promises, Johnson looks set to suffer yet another rejection.Poisoned AppleâWe want an election because we look forward to turfing this government out,â opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn responded. âThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White by the wicked queen -- because what heâs offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.âCorbyn said he would back an election once the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit had become law.The back-and-forth took place after MPs moved decisively to stop Britain lurching out of the European Union without an agreement in eight weeksâ time. Johnson failed to stop the House of Commons voting for a draft law designed to thwart his plan to take the U.K. out of the EU -- with or without a deal -- on Oct. 31. Instead, MPs voted by 327 to 299 in favor of forcing Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit by three months to Jan. 31 if he canât get a deal agreed, or if he fails to persuade Parliament to leave the bloc without one.The bill will now move to the unelected second chamber, the House of Lords. It needs to pass in both houses to become law.The PurgeJohnson resisted the draft law with all his power. On Tuesday night he fired 21 MPs from his ruling Conservative Party after they refused to carry out his orders and voted against him. On Wednesday, Johnson said again he will never ask the EU for another delay to Brexit.&quot;It is clear that there is therefore only one way forward for this country,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;The country must now decide whether the leader of the opposition or I go to those negotiations in Brussels on 17 October to sort this out.&quot;Johnson is going to push hard to get this election.If he loses the vote proposing a snap poll on Wednesday, he is planning to try again on Monday, people familiar with the matter said. He told a private meeting of Tory MPs that he wants to get on with the election campaign, as itâs the only way to break the deadlock.But his plan is a huge gamble. Two years ago Theresa May called a snap election expecting to win a landslide. Instead, she lost the majority she started with, a failure that resulted in the chaos and confusion that has engulfed British politics ever since.&#92;--With assistance from Alex Morales and Jessica Shankleman.To contact the reporters on this story: Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net;Kitty Donaldson in London at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-03,205.7,209.19,3.49,0.016966456,Don't move,2,9,626,13,2.07667731629393

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday.Source: George Dolgikh / Shutterstock.com iPhone SE 2: A new rumor claims that Apple is working on the next iPhone SE, reports 9to5Mac. According to this rumor, the tech company is going to release the iPhone Se 2 in spring 2020. The rumor says that this will be a 4.7-inch smartphone with an LCD display. These rumors also claim that the device will be incredibly similar to the iPhone 8. This likely means it will retain Touch ID instead of switching to Face ID.New TV: A recent rumor says that the next Apple TV may be coming soon, MacRumors notes. The rumor comes from a leaked code name for the device, which is &quot;J305AP.&quot; The exact reveal date of the device is unknown, but it's completely possible that the tech company will announce it during its upcoming September event. If so, it might not be long before it hits store shelves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNew Betas: There are new betas of iOS 13.1, iPadOS 13.1 and tvOS 13 available to download, reports AppleInsider.

The second iOS 13.1 and iPadOS 13.1 betas come out roughly one week after the first betas were sent out to developers.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) mavens are expressing disappointment over rumors indicating benchmarks on the iPhone 11 are &quot;disturbingly&quot; low.Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com Specifications on the phones, to be formally announced Sept. 10, have been leaking to the media for days. The main improvements seem to be new cameras, with storage starting at 64 gigabytes and prices starting at $750. The high-end iPhone 11 Pro Max will start at $1,100 with up to 512 gigabytes of storage.Tech reporters are hoping that a new iPad will be announced at the event, or at least an Apple Watch. Otherwise they fear they'll be bored.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut it's the new Apple strategy that should be making headlines. AAPL's Market Share ProblemApple has been losing sales and share for three years now, but it may finally be doing something about it. That something won't be announced next week. It would be a new iPhone SE, similar in size to the iPhone 8 from 2017, aimed at competing on price against Huawei and other Asian phone makers.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Half of Apple's iPhone sales come on older or cheaper models of the product, especially in the developing world. A new iPhone SE would finally sunset the iPhone 7 design and cost about $500 to purchase new. Apple's current user base consists of about 900 million phones. Analysts believe 270 million could be upgraded, and perhaps resold by Apple.AAPL will make about 75 million iPhone 11 models for the current launch period, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who sees pent-up demand for the product. The Service TurnBut if Apple is serious about competing on price again in markets like India and Southeast Asia, it could be a sea change for the company given the other moves it has made.Increasingly Apple's success is tied to its services, which represented 21% of revenues according to its most recent quarterly report.Apple draws almost twice as much revenue from services as it does from the Macintosh, and more than twice what it makes from the iPad or wearables like the Apple Watch. Apple reported 64% margins on that service revenue, against 30% for products.Apple's capital spending is estimated at $14 billion for 2019, down $2 billion from last year. But that may be misleading. Unlike the other &quot;Cloud Czars,&quot; Apple puts a lot of its capital to work on manufacturing plants. It also makes a lot of use of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud.The company runs its own data centers in the U.S. and Europe, contracting out its Chinese operations.  The bottom line is that Apple runs some data through its own servers and some data through third parties, giving it a global footprint at minimal cost.This is not a secret. Apple has introduced a host of new paid services this year, including a news app, Apple TV and the Apple Card credit card. They run best on Apple hardware. Android users barely know they exist. The Bottom Line on Apple StockTech analysts focus on the new iPhones. Investors need to focus on the whole line -- and on service revenue.Under Tim Cook Apple has learned to squeeze increasing amounts of lifetime revenue from each Apple customer, thanks to its services, which are phenomenally profitable.Getting customers in the door is thus more important than making money off the initial sale. Analysts should be focused on the average revenue per user of Apple's user base, not the bright, shiny objects executives hold up next Tuesday.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

693,1456,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-threats-continue-weigh-netflix-174311439.html?.tsrc=rss,3 Threats That Continue to Weigh Netflix Stock Down,2019-09-03,"Neftlix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is not the darling tech stock it once was. After a meteoric rise that saw Netflix stock reach an all-time high in 2018, NFLX is coming back to earth a bit. That's if you can call a 40% correction a bit.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com NFLX stock has bounced off the low it reached in last year's December selloff. However, most of that bounce came as all stocks rallied off their December lows. Despite being up for the year, Netflix stock is down over 15% from a January 15 close of $351.39.The good news is the stock has still retained most of the gains it made since 2017. The bad news is that NFLX stock seems to be stuck in a neutral pattern as institutional investors are trying to decide what's next for the streaming giant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy for September That's not an easy question to answer. Netflix stock faces significant headwinds on three fronts: NFLX Continues to Burn Through CashNetflix became synonymous with binge watching and streaming television by producing original content. It started with House of Cards in 2013 and the stable has grown to include The Crown, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, Ozark and Stranger Things.The company has received critical acclaim for its programming. But it takes a lot of money to produce original content, and NFLX is burning through cash and taking on debt. In 2018, the company reported a $3 billion loss in non-GAAP free cash flow. And with the company becoming increasingly dependent on original content, it does not appear this trend will reverse anytime soon. Netflix Faces a Declining Subscriber BaseAn investment in original content can be justified as long as the company continues to add new subscribers. Netflix has a healthy subscriber base. But in recent months, they have been losing momentum in adding subscribers.In their most recent quarterly earnings report, Netflix reported a gigantic miss in new subscribers. The company's own estimates were targeting 5 million new subscribers, but NFLX only added 2.7 million. The company was anticipating a boost in viewership from the summer release of Stranger Things and Season 7 of Orange is the New Black, but it remains to be seen if that will translate to new subscribers. Increased CompetitionBy now you're aware that Disney (NYSE:DIS), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all entering what is becoming a crowded streaming space.As consumers weigh a variety of digital content providers, they are realizing that each provider is carving out a niche for themselves. For example, Disney will have family oriented programming and the exclusive rights to Disney content formerly found on, among others, Netflix. This is leading to a growing sense of &quot;streaming fatigue.&quot; By subscribing to multiple streaming services, consumers are realizing they are mostly negating the cost savings they were receiving by cutting the cord.This means that the streaming wars will be survival of the most useful. Will Netflix make the cut? What's Next for Netflix Stock?The trend is not a friend for NFLX at the moment. Based on any meaningful metric (moving averages, RSI, etc.), Netflix stock looks like it still has room to fall. Over the next six months, investors will get a better read on if Netflix will be able to retain existing customers as other streaming services launch.In my opinion, the issue won't be price. Consumers have never seemed to balk at the value of a Netflix subscription. In fact prior to the previous quarter, Netflix was continuing to grow their subscriber base even as they increased the price of their packages.As I see it, a bigger problem for Netflix comes down to programming. Despite their pivot into producing original content, two of the most popular series on Netflix remain The Office and Friends. Neither of these titles will be available to Netflix subscribers after 2020. Friends will stream exclusively on HBO Max starting in the spring of 2020 and The Office will be moving over to NBCUniversal's service when the contract with Netflix expires at the end of 2020.  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy If Netflix can entice consumers with new original content, then they may be a bargain. If not, NFLX stock could be ready to tumble likeâ¦wait for itâ¦a house of cards. Until investors get a better read on subscriber loyalty, it appears there are better stocks to look at.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

701,1464,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-discovers-iphone-attack-220043641.html?.tsrc=rss,Google Discovers iPhone Attack,2019-09-02,"Google researchers have discovered that iPhone users have been vulnerable to more than two dozen attacks for the past two years. Hacked Ahead of its upcoming September 10th product launch, Googleâs Threat Analysis Group has announced that it found that a small collection of hacked websites were able to attack iPhones and install a monitoring implant. These implants would allow hackers to collect usersâ text messages, photos and locations. Apple patched the vulnerability, which has existed for two years, after Google brought it to their attention, back in February. Apparently, simply visiting the websites was enough to place the iPhone in danger. Danger Zone Googleâs Threat Analysis Group did not name the hacked websites, but noted âthese sites receive thousands of visitors per week.â Marcus Hutchins, a popular security expert, âspeculated that state-sponsored actors may be behind the attack.â Cooked? Apple is generally considered to have some of the most secure products on the market, and famously eschews the data-for-sale marketing practices Facebook and Google are often criticized for, so to have a rival point out their flaws has to sting. This is just not news that Chief Operating Executive Tim Cook needed out there, especially after heâs already had to apologize for Apple hiring third-party contractors to transcribe conversations captured by Siri, and the general slowdown of iPhone sales, as only hardcore Apple stans now feel the need to buy the latest iPhone model year after year. Appleâs new trade-in programs and financing plans have helped reduce the decline in iPhone sales to 11% from a 16% drop, and the company remains enthusiastic about its upcoming streaming service, but this is still a black eye for Apple.

I'd suggest looking past the headlines and at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). There's solid evidence in favor of believing in GOOGL. Along with two strategies for enabling stronger risk-adjusted returns, the case for buying Alphabet stock is an easy one. Let me explain.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com The verdict is in. No, not the one against Alphabet and peers Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Don't forget, U.S. authorities are investigating those companies for flexing monopolistic muscle over consumers. That decision won't be known for some time. For GOOGL stock investors, it's price action above all else which matters most.Bottom line, despite combustible headlines and elevated market volatility this past month, a bullish technical-based follow-through day on Aug. 13 has been confirmed. I've discussed this a number of times in recent InvestorPlace articles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHistorically, almost every significant market rally has begun with this type of bottoming action. As much, I can't understate the importance of the follow-through day when considering a buy decision in highly correlated, market-weighted stocks. Coupled with GOOGL's recent burly earnings beat and the fact that shares are at a key inflection point on the price chart, it's time to put Alphabet on the radar for a stronger purchase. GOOGL Stock Price ChartTechnically, Alphabet stock's earnings-driven spike of nearly 10% last month proved key in dismantling a price chart which had been prone to a much larger correction. The timing of the bullish reaction immediately before the broader market came under pressure was unfortunate. But, not entirely.A bearish environment for risky assets resulted in a lower high and GOOGL shares sliding back beneath key lateral and psychological price resistance of $1,200. Nevertheless, with the market's follow-through day in place, investors can use the pullback in Alphabet stock to their advantage. Two Alphabet Stock StrategiesThe first approach to going long Alphabet stock is to buy shares on a move through $1,207. This entry waits for a breakout above price resistance. I wrote about this strategy a couple weeks back in an article on gaming stocks to buy. With the additional time to consolidate and a more positive market environment, a second attempt entry is all the more compelling. I'd recommend sizing the position for a blended exit below $1,135 if necessary.Another means to gain long exposure in GOOGL is through Alphabet stock's options. Using a limited and reduced risk, entering a position today makes enough sense. One strategy I favor is the Dec $1,250/$1310 call spread.This Alphabet vertical is priced for around $20 or less than 2% of the risk associated with owning shares. If GOOGL can rally into the year's end and hit marginally new all-time-highs. You can extract a profit of $40 or return of 200% from the position versus a return of approximately 10% in Alphabet stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

726,1489,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-mergers-no-silver-bullet-032106937.html?.tsrc=rss,Bank Mergers Are No Silver Bullet for India,2019-09-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With every passing day, Indiaâs economic indicators are turning a little bleaker.Â The situation is bad enough to warrant using the word âcrisis,â arrivingÂ just asÂ theÂ governmentâs fiscal ammunition is spent.The announcement Friday of 5% GDP growth in the June quarter showed the economy growing at its weakest pace in six years. OnÂ Sunday, the top six carmakers reported aÂ 29% drop in August sales,Â stokingÂ fears that the slowdown could get still worse.Â Â The 982 billion rupees ($13.7 billion) collected in August via the goods and services tax, the main tax on consumption, was the smallest in six months.Â This addsÂ pressure on the central bank â both to cut its policy rateÂ and to ensure that commercial lenders pass them on to borrowers.Â To the extent thatÂ the more inefficient state-run banks are a drag on credit, New Delhi said Friday that as many as 10 of them will be merged into four.WhetherÂ folding one weak bank into another will make the combined entity any stronger remains to be seen. Whatâs clearerÂ is that these lenders will spend the next six months on integration. Putting their balance sheets to work may take a backseat. Pending consolidation, the lenders mightÂ also be hesitant to issue new bank guarantees, especially to private-sector bidders for road projects. Thus, oneÂ of the few areasÂ where thereâsÂ new investment may be affected, especially with a sharpÂ rise in debt levels of the government agency that gives out the contracts.Â A hefty injection of 552.5Â billion rupees of taxpayersâ moneyÂ into the merged banks will only help them provide forÂ the bad loans that will get lumped together. Capital for growth remains elusive.Â State Bank of India, the largest lender, will require 150 billion rupees in the current fiscal year, according to ICRA Ltd., an affiliate of Moodyâs Investors Service.Â The benefits will only be evident in a few years.Â The new round ofÂ consolidation will bring down the number of state-run banksÂ to 12 from 27 just a few years ago. These lenders will have no choice butÂ to become more competitive because theyâll have to price consumer loans by linking them to the central bankâs policy rate. Since they arenât very good at lending against cash flows, the government wants them to originate loans together with non-bank financiers. Currently, even the shadow banks are stressed.Â Over time, though, thisÂ should helpÂ boost the underwriting standards of state-controlled lenders. Credit flows to smaller firms, which supply goods and services to larger companies,Â will improve.Â Making the most of vendorÂ finance will require plugging India into global supply chains first. By offering the likes of Apple Inc. andÂ Ikea less restrictive access to its billion-plus population, New Delhi is hoping for long-term sourcing wins from the rapidly deteriorating trade relations between Washington and Beijing.But while taking much-neglected steps to position India as an alternative to China is a welcome move, the gains wonât be immediate. Before committing to a new factory in India to both sell locally and to export, investors will want to see steadier final demand in the domestic economy.Â Maruti Suzuki Ltd., the nationâs biggest carmaker, is strugglingÂ to push out 100,000 cars in a month to dealers ahead of the festival season. ThatÂ isnât exactly a great advertisement to dangle before new entrants.Â Â Good things will comeÂ from all the tinkeringÂ âÂ just not now.Â Weakening global growth means India canât even use a weak currency to export its way out of trouble. ThisÂ isnâtÂ the time to talk loudly about wanting to become the next China. AÂ hawkish Washington wonât want to see mercantile strategies being deployed by yet another large labor-surplus nation.Â Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs best hope will be to use the crisis to mendÂ his governmentâs frayed relationship with the private sector. GivingÂ startups a reprieve from a seven-year-old law, one that wasÂ used by tax authorities to harass them with impunity, is a good move.Admitting that there areÂ design flawsÂ in the consumption tax and fixing them â perhaps by bringing separately taxed petroleum products into itsÂ ambitÂ âÂ shouldÂ be the next step. Like with the bank mergers, the gains will take time time to become evident, even as the pain gets visibly worse.Â Â To contact the author of this story: Andy Mukherjee at amukherjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

727,1490,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-fragility-show-trade-war-073110517.html?.tsrc=rss,"Market Fragility on Show as Trade War, China Data Curb Optimism",2019-09-02,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war just ratcheted up another notch and the outlook for Chinese manufacturing deteriorated further, signaling the caution that characterized a tumultuous August for global markets may have further to run.And, with the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday, trading in Treasuries will be quiet. In Asia, focus will be on shares of Apple Inc. suppliers and clothing manufacturers to gauge the reaction to the latest round of tariff hikes.The U.S. implemented 15% tariffs on about $110 billion in apparel, footwear and other Chinese imports on Sunday. Face-to-face talks between American and Chinese trade negotiators scheduled for Washington this month were still on track, President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday.âThis is the mother of all questions: Is Mr. Trump going to escalate or de-escalate over the next year?â Luciano Jannelli, head of investment strategy at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, told Bloomberg TV on Sunday. âItâs difficult to say.âAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates, Chinese exports of shoes and clothing to the U.S. could drop by more than 3% year-on-year in the second half of this year as a result of the tariffs.Further ComplicationsâThe tensions will escalate and many official bank house views that had a U.S.-China trade deal over time as the base-case scenario might have to revise this as the clashes in Hong Kong further complicate any discussion between the Trump administration and the Chinese Communist Party,â said Rainer Michael Preiss, a portfolio strategist at Taurus Wealth Advisors Pte.Data on Saturday showed Chinaâs manufacturing sector remains under pressure. The purchasing managersâ index dropped to 49.5, marking the fourth month of shrinking factory output in the worldâs second-largest economy.Still, the latest tariffs that came into effect on Sunday were widely anticipated and may already be reflected in market prices, some investors said.âThe market expected the tariffsâ to kick in, said Kerry Goh, CEO and CIO of Kamet Capital Partners Pte., a Singapore-based multi-family office. âI donât think there will be a big moveâ on Monday.For Jingyi Pan, a strategist at IG Asia Pte., it remains prudent to play defensive.âIt does appear that the disagreements between the two sides will drag on with negotiations yet to lead to any way out of the current gridlock,â she said.Here are a few areas to monitor in trading on Monday:Apple SuppliersThe new duties will hit Apple products that made up at least 10% of sales in the companyâs 2018 fiscal year, such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and iMac computers, according to Bloomberg data. Shares of Foxconn Technology Group, the U.S. companyâs main assembly partner, dropped as much as 0.5% and Luxshare Precision Industry Co., which provides components for wearable devices like the Apple Watch, fell 0.3% in early trading.GoldA more than 7% surge for gold in August looked set to go further after ending last month at about $1,520 an ounce, with the spot price up 0.3% on Monday. âItâs not just the tariffs but the Hong Kong unrest that could lead to renewed buying interest in gold,â said Preiss. The Singapore-based executive said gold could hit $2,000 over the next 12 months, bolstered by trade woes and further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Manufacturer StocksApparel and footwear manufacturers that derive revenues from Chinese exports to the U.S. are in the line of fire. Hong Kong-listed Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., for one, makes about 13% of its shoes in China and is one of the largest shoemakers for Nike and Adidas globally, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The stock gained 1.3% after falling as much as 1.3%. Taiwanese footware manufacturer Pou Chen Corp. dropped as much as 0.4%.&#92;--With assistance from Manus Cranny.To contact the reporter on this story: Ishika Mookerjee in Singapore at imookerjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lianting Tu at ltu4@bloomberg.net, Teo Chian Wei, Naoto HosodaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-09-02,208.74,205.7,-3.04,-0.014563572,Don't move,6,29,642,41,6.386292834890965

At 12.01 a.m. local time on Sunday in Washington, the levies will kick in for hundreds of products entering the U.S. or being withdrawn from warehouses for consumption in the U.S., according to the order.One veteran analyst was holding out hope for a last-minute reprieve.âThe U.S. adding tariffs to any Apple product without some type of corresponding offset to mitigate the negative effects crosses the Rubicon on many dimensions,â Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, wrote in a note on Friday. âWe believe the U.S. does not want to be the first to add tariffs to Apple, given Apple is arguably the leading U.S. company and the face of American business in China. The optics of a U.S. protectionist first approach penalizing a U.S. global leading company while China doesnât penalize Apple would seem to surrender the moral high ground.âAny reprieve for Apple looked unlikely on Friday as Trump showed little sign of backing down and blamed U.S. companies for their inability to deal with a trade policy he said was aimed at reining in âunfair players.â Apple didnât respond to requests for comment.Hereâs a list of Apple products that will be hit by 15% tariffs starting this weekend:Apple Watch and Watch bandsAirPodsHomePodSome Beats headphonesIMac computersRepair parts for iPhones may also be hitNand flash, a key storage component for iPhones, could also be affectedThe iPhone, which contributes more than half of Appleâs revenue, wonât face this 15% tariff until Dec. 15. But the other hardware products made up at least 10% of sales in the companyâs 2018 fiscal year, and many of these will have to absorb the 15% import levy that kicks in on Sunday.Itâs unclear if Apple will raise product prices or assume the cost of the tariffs. The company, one of the worldâs most profitable, maintains higher margins than most other consumer hardware makers.A 15% tariff on Apple wearable gadgets sold in the U.S. would likely reduce earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share per year, Munster estimated on Friday. Analysts, on average, estimate Appleâs adjusted profit will be $11.63 a share in the 2019 fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Apple has been lobbying Trump for more than a year to avoid tariffs. During a recent dinner with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook voiced concerns that Appleâs main rival Samsung Electronics Co. will get an edge because its products wonât be subject to the levies.Just days after that dinner, Trump announced that tariffs on $300 billion of goods from China would be 15%, up from 10%. These take effect in two tranches, which the first batch happening Sept. 1.Apple spent decades building one of the largest supply chains in the world. The company designs and sells most of its products in the U.S., but imports them from China after assembly. That makes it one of the most exposed companies to tariffs.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-29,209.01,208.74,-0.27,-0.001291804,Don't move,10,24,602,44,7.308970099667775

              <p>I'm Stephen Nellis with Reuters in San Francisco. At Apple's event in Cupertino in September, we're expecting to see new iPhones new Apple watches and other hardware updates. And while investors will be watching for the usual things like how many cameras the iPhone has, whether there are any new sensors on the device, they're also going to be watching for something that's become very important during the trade conflict between the US and China, and that is prices. </p>
              <p>Apple usually introduces the new iPhone with a new price, and then they reprice the entire rest of the iPhone lineup, typically dropping older models by about one hundred dollars each year. Most years, that's a fairly predictable process. But this year will be smack in the middle of a conflict between the U.S. and China over tariffs. And investors will be watching closely to see if Apple does anything different with that pricing because of that trade war. </p>
              <p>The other thing that we expect to see at this event in September from Apple is updates on its services business. Investors really like those services, because they give Apple a way to continue to make money off of its customers even if they haven't upgraded their phone. </p>
              <p>Now that's also led to some interesting changes in Apple's business strategy. The company used to be all about selling a new phone to customers but now they're encouraging customers to hold onto those phones for a longer time and stay in the Apple ecosystem. </p>
              <p>Just on Thursday Apple said that they would for the first time ever sell genuine Apple parts to independent repair shops. What that means is that that kiosk that you've seen in the mall or other independent shops that aren't an authorized service center will now have access to the actual Apple parts just like you would get if you went to the Apple store. It's part of Apple's bigger strategy to grow their installed base of people who have an iPhone buy as much as possible so they can sell them things like Apple Music or accessories like the air pods or the Apple Watch.</p>",2019-08-28,205.53,209.01,3.48,0.016931835,Don't move,15,15,443,45,10.15801354401806

However, if the past few weeks have been any lesson, it's to take Thursday's price action with a grain of salt.

Movers in the Stock Market TodayThe Federal Trade Commission is getting busy, with a few reports popping up with recent inquiries and investigations. On the list is Juul, for which the FTC is looking into its marketing practices. While Juul is a private company, it counts Altria (NYSE:MO) as an investor. MO fell about 3.5% on the day. And don't forget about the merger talks with Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), which tacked on another 2% loss for the day.Over the last five days, MO and PM are down 5.2% and 12.5%, respectively.The FTC is also requesting privacy information from Charter Communications (NYSE:CHTR).As you noticed above, a number of retailers caught a boost on Thursday, and Bed, Bath & Beyond (NYSE:BBBY) was no exception. Shares climbed more than 11% on the day on mergers and acquisitions talk. According to reports, the retailer has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to help it explore bids.But a little word of caution: The reports do not confirm there is an interested party and BBBY has struggled immensely over the past few years.Finally, the cloud-computing space is a constant battle among big tech. It's also a growth engine for small- and mid-cap companies. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now taking market share from cloud-leader Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).&quot;We are seeing a clear acceleration of larger and more strategic enterprise cloud deals (both domestically as well as in Europe),&quot; Ives said, adding that he believes Microsoft is poised to win the lion's share of the next phase of cloud deployments.Ives also reiterated his outperform rating and $160 price target on MSFT stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Of course, the rally was nice, but it was accompanied by doubts, confirmed by some Chinese media, that the president hadn't actually talked to anyone in China about cooling off the long-running tensions.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Fortunately, that confirmation emerged today that two sides are indeed discussing trade and that helped stocks focus on something other than the second-quarter GDP revision, was pared down to growth of 2.1%. There was some good news in that GDP report that indicates the oft-discussed recession isn't as imminent as previously thought.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Second-quarter consumer spending surged 4.7%, above the 4.3% forecast in July, good for the best reading in five years. That coupled with the trade talks sent the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.48% while the S&P 500 gained 1.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average got in on the fun with a Thursday gain of 1.25%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 25 of the 30 Dow members were trading higher, indicating broad-based strength in the blue chip index today. Tech TalkAs always, it's good to see technology stocks lead a rally. That was the case today with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gaining 1.89%. Already one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow this year, Microsoft was boosted today by some positive analyst commentary with Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives reiterating an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the shares, citing strength in the Azure cloud business.&quot;We are bullish on MSFT over the next year given our thesis that Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out within the company's massive installed base,&quot; said Ives in a note.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another solid Dow technology performer today, adding 1.69% after the company announced a Sept. 10 event to reveal the latest iPhone.&quot;Apple typically puts new iPhones on sale within two weeks following their launch and rolls out the accompanying software update a few days after showing off the devices,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;The new iPhones will be key to Apple's holiday quarter.&quot; Careful With This BounceCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was the best-performing member of the Dow today with a gain of 2.69%, not a surprising move given this stock's level of tariff sensitivity. There are still some structural issues in the industrial sector and President Trump's willingness to rapidly reverse course on trade has previously punished cyclical names like Caterpillar.Another bounce I'd caution on is that of the financials, particularly on a day when Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), formerly though not currently a Dow component, was hit with a downgrade due to rising concern about net interest margins. That is not a scenario that's specific to BAC shares. Dow Jones Bottom LineI wanted to save this for tomorrow, the last trading day of the month, but I'll roll it out today. Historically, September is the worst month of the year for stocks with the S&P 500 averaging a September decline of 1.1% over the past two decades.However, a couple of Dow stocks are among the best S&P 500 performers in September over the past decade. Those names are Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

That's a shame. No matter what, the company is an icon of American industry. Prior to the digitalization age, you could count on General Electric stock to give you steady, reliable returns. Now, the only thing that's reliable is that the bloated and confusing organization will attract scorn.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com But even with this new and negative reputation for General Electric stock, the underlying company fell to fresh depths. In the middle of August, financial analyst Harry Markopolos sounded the alarm on GE, accusing it of being &quot;a bigger fraud than Enron.&quot; To support his audacious claim, he produced a 175-page report detailing management's alleged accounting shenanigans. After this stunning disclosure, the GE stock price tanked 11%.Making matters worse is Markopolos' reputation. For those unfamiliar with the financial markets, you might be surprised that one person can take the GE stock price down so sharply. However, Markopolos rose to fame when he blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff, who the media proclaims to be the &quot;Ponzi king.&quot; To me, he's more like a multi-level marketing dirtbag calling you at 3:00 a.m. about some vitamin drink.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut my point here is that Markopolos has serious clout. Today, everyone knows about the Madoff scandal. But what many may still not realize was that Markopolos banged on regulators' doors until the fraud came to light. And now he's pounding the bearish table on General Electric stock.You better know what you're doing to level this kind of accusation. GE Dropped Because of Markopolos' Reputation, Not Report's SubstanceYears ago, I got into a debate with a fellow trader about investment advice. In short, his position was that information was tied to the source. To illustrate, he said he'd never take stock tips from a hot dog vendor.In contrast, I replied that we should judge information on its own merits, whatever the source. From my point of view, advice from a renowned expert isn't guaranteed to be profitable. Besides, I love hot dogs.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income And I think this is the primary issue with the Markopolos report: His reputation preceded him and it unfairly tanked the GE stock price.Let me be clear: I'm not suggesting that General Electric stock is the paragon of stability. Clearly, the underlying company has severe problems which it must overcome. But accounting fraud? You need serious firepower to back up that claim, and I believe Markopolos has fallen short.For instance, in his actual report -- and not someone's editorial about it -- Markopolos lamented that GE frequently changed its reporting formats. He then concludes that this is due to either fraud or incompetence. What? Those are extreme conclusions that don't address the spectrum of other possible answers. Granted, the constant shift between formats is frustrating. But there's nothing wrong with the accounting change itself. For example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) no longer breaks down its iPhone quarterly sales. Are we going to assume massive fraud in Cupertino?Again, this is not necessarily my defense of General Electric stock. But I don't like to see high-level accusations based largely on the reputations of the involved parties.Markopolos bagged a fraud whale with Madoff. The GE stock price continuously tests worrying support levels all on its own. But the mere existence of these two facts neither bolsters nor dissuades from Markopolos' argument. General Electric Stock Is an Interesting but Risky TradeWhen GE's management team responded that Markopolos was engaging in market manipulation, their retort had weight. That's because the financial analyst has a credibility challenge to overcome.I'm not talking about him writing on behalf of a fund manager shorting General Electric stock. That's another story that I don't want to get into at this time. But to be fair, Markopolos did disclose this conflict of interest. No, I'm referring to an even bigger credibility problem: If Markopolos is correct about his charge, how the heck did regulators not discover this on their own?In his report, Markopolos claimed that GE used the &quot;dog that didn't bark method&quot; by getting rid of the dog. In other words, GE deliberately hid financially damaging information from shareholders and regulators. But I just don't find that plausible, considering that General Electric stock was a long-time mainstay of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.You can't just willy-nilly hide stuff when you're under the world's biggest financial spotlight.As such, I believe the GE stock price got a raw deal from the fraud claim. And that to me makes shares an interesting trading idea because they could bounce back up, however briefly. After all, the report has already done its damage.But again, let's not do a reverse-Markopolos here. I'm not suggesting that General Electric stock is a contrarian investment. Right now, it's a very speculative trade, but one that has a stronger probability of moving to the upside.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

One of the companies on Luke's list is AT&T (NYSE:T). With several streaming offerings on the go, he believes AT&T stock is the best of the bunch from a value perspective. Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut is it the best?Here are my two cents on the subject.  The Argument for AT&T StockIn terms of the sheer number of offerings, AT&T's way ahead of the competition. By the time it launches HBO Max in the spring, AT&T will have a total of seven streaming services through both the AT&T and HBO brands. &quot;AT&T's streaming TV push over the next few years could be tremendously successfully,&quot; Lango stated. &quot;Tremendous success on the streaming TV front isn't priced into dirt-cheap AT&T stock today. As such, the potential upside in AT&T stock from the streaming TV gold rush is quite compelling.&quot;  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects Hey, you can't argue with his logic. AT&T bought Time Warner specifically for all its great content, including HBO. And yet, T stock trades at just 1.4 times sales, well below Disney (NYSE:DIS) at a P/S of 3.2, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 3.7, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) at 7.5, and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) at 16.8.If value is your only consideration, I don't think there's any question AT&T stock is at the front of the pack.  AT&T Stock and the CompetitionOf the five streaming stocks, only Roku doesn't generate an operating profit at the moment, and while I'm a big fan of Roku's business model, for this article, I won't include ROKU stock in my determination of whether AT&T is the best streaming stock to buy. That being said, if the risk is no object, let me stop you right now. Roku, in my opinion, is the best of the streaming stocks for the simple reason that it's streaming agnostic. It wins no matter which of the content aggregators becomes the favorite of consumers five years down the road. However, it's only appropriate for investors willing to assume above-average risk resulting from its money-losing operations. So, right now, excluding Roku, Netflix is the favorite.  AT&T Is Less StellarIt's impossible to know if one of the other three (Disney, Apple, and AT&T) will take the lead, or perhaps a new entrant arrives on the scene in a couple of years that takes video streaming to another level. We don't know. To be considered the best streaming stock for this article, not only should a prospective company have a competitive streaming service, but it should also have strong cash flow generation and a healthy balance sheet. Why?Because if you exclude a stock like Roku, which has an excellent risk-to-reward ratio, it makes no sense to invest in something that's got weak fundamentals and zero chance of winning the streaming wars. Of the three stocks, early indications suggest that the Disney bundle at $12.99 -- ESPN+, Disney+ and an ad-supported version of Hulu -- is going to be fierce competition for Apple, AT&T, and even Netflix.I'm not saying it's going to be better than HBO Max or Apple TV+, but from a pricing perspective, it's hard to see how Disney doesn't pull in a boatload of subscribers.  Financials and StreamingAs for financial strength, Disney finished the third quarter with $59.3 billion in debt and $7.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents for net debt of $51.9 billion or 21% of its market cap. By comparison, Apple finished its latest quarter with net cash of $156.3 billion or 17% of its market cap while AT&T had $149.4 billion in net debt at the end of June, which is 59% of its market cap. In the trailing 12 months, Disney, Apple, and AT&T had free cash flow of $3.35 billion, $58.3 billion, and $29.4 billion, respectively. As Disney fully integrates 21st Century Fox's assets, the free cash flow generation will increase substantially. To a lesser extent, the same could be said about AT&T. Even though Apple is likely viewed as delivering the least competitive streaming product, the fact that it generates so much free cash flow and holds so much cash compared to the other two, it's hard not to like a side bet on Apple TV+.  The Bottom Line on AT&T StockIf financials are the only consideration amongst streaming stocks, I don't think there's any doubt that Apple provides the least amount of risk between itself, Disney, and AT&T.If the best offering is the only consideration, Disney appears to have the streaming package that will bring in the most subscribers. As for AT&T, the fact that it's got a smorgasbord of streaming offerings that are bound to confuse consumers, combined with the fact it has a hellish amount of debt, suggests that its stock isn't the best from a streaming or financial perspective. Despite its value, I don't see how it's the best of the streaming stocks.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Yet, AAPL stock often seems to take a back seat to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or one of the other FAANGs. Source: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShort Hills Capital Managing Partner Steve Weiss recently suggested on CNBC that Apple CEO Tim Cook's close relationship with President Trump is a big reason he owns AAPL stock. It's the whole idea of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer.   &quot;I like the fact that Cook continues to have the ear of the President. He's one of the few people who can walk both sides,&quot; Weiss said in his Aug. 20 appearance. &quot;He transferred some production recently to China and yet he still has Trump's ear, and Trump spoke positively about the arguments he made about the competitive disadvantage it would suffer to Samsung if they continue with the tariffs.&quot;While it's impossible to know how the U.S.-China trade war will turn out given the unpredictability of both Trump and Beijing, the fact that Cook's been able to keep an open dialogue with the administration, as Weiss suggests, is a real positive for Apple and owners of Apple stock.As the FAANG stocks go, a case could be made for holding all of them in your portfolio. However, for me, Apple is currently at the top of my list for several reasons, in addition to Cook's close relationship with Trump.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall Here are but three.  Free Cash FlowI love free cash flow generators. The more, the merrier. Apple generated $58.3 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. That's 22.5% of revenue over the same period. By comparison, Amazon had $22.1 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months on $252.1 billion in revenue. That's a free cash flow margin of 8.8% or one-third Apple's. Currently, Apple's free cash flow yield is 6.0%, more than double Amazon's FCF yield. If you believe, as I do, that free cash flow provides greater operational flexibility, than there's no question that Apple stock is a good FAANG stock. Not to mention, free cash flow allows Apple to buy back more of its stock, which leads to higher EPS growth.  Share RepurchasesOn April 30, Apple's board increased its share repurchase program authorization by 75% to $175 billion. Of the $175 billion, $78.2 billion has already been repurchased, through June 29. That leaves $96.8 billion in buybacks in the future. In the nine months ended June 29, the company had repurchased $49.2 billion of AAPL stock at an average price of $194.77, providing shareholders with a 5.6% return on investment based on a current share price of $205.67. Over the past five years, Apple has reduced its share count by 28% through share repurchases. Using $1 million in net earnings and 100,000 shares outstanding as an example, a 28% cut in shares over five years would mean an increase of 38% in earnings per share without any increase in net earnings over the same period. While I'm generally opposed to share repurchases because companies tend to overpay for their stock, when you generate as much free cash flow as Apple does, it's much harder to make the same argument. As long as Apple continues to generate 20% or more free cash flow margins, I can't see them being a problem. In periods of slow growth, they'll act as an artificial floor for the Apple stock price.  Services Bring BalanceIn the third quarter, Apple's services revenue accounted for 21.4% of the company's $53.8 billion in overall sales. However, services accounted for 36.3% of its $20.2 billion in gross profit.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential So, while Apple's iPhone sales declined by 12% during the quarter, its total net sales increased by 1%. That's due to a healthy 13% increase in services and a robust 48% increase in its wearables, home and accessories sales, which includes AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc. If you believe that Apple's iPhone sales will increase in a significant manner once it has its 5G phones on the market in the next 12-24 months, as Weiss and others do, the latest lull in earnings ought to be short-lived.  Bottom Line on AAPL StockIt's hard to argue with Warren Buffett's giant-sized position in AAPL stock. It's not perfect by any means, but it presents the best combination of value and growth. For this reason, it is my favorite of the FAANGs. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

When the closing bell sounded the Nasdaq Composite was lower by 0.34% while the S&P 500 closed down by 0.32%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.47%. In late trading, just 11, or barely more than a third, of the Dow's 30 components were in the green.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow An interesting fact, courtesy of the ETF Research Center: the price-to-earnings ratio on the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA), the Dow tracking ETF, currently resides in an area that was seen following the fourth-quarter 2018 and May 2019 declines, which eventually gave way to equity market rallies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Healthcare CheckupAs I mentioned yesterday, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was waiting on a ruling from an Oklahoma judge in the opioid case. That ruling was publicized late Monday and Dow components JNJ is on the hook for more than $572 million, a mere penance for an almost-$347 billion company that generates as much free cash as JNJ does. So shares of JNJ jumped 1.44% today, but one analyst indicated investors may not be paying attention to the fine print.&quot;J&J held a 1% market share of Oklahoma's opioid market, far less than Purdue and Teva, which settled for $270m and $85m, respectively,&quot; said Berenberg Capital Markets analyst Patrick Trucchio. &quot;Thus, to us, the $572m judgment is very bearish; if it holds on appeal, it could put a bear case scenario of $150bn of litigation liabilities for all opioid playersâ¦in all tracks (i.e., states, federal MDL, DOJâ¦in play.&quot;UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) remains a dog among Dow healthcare stocks as highlighted by today's slide of 3.57%. I've noted multiple times this year that UNH has been plagued by political concerns, meaning the Medicare For All debate, but the stock's woes are mounting outside of the political arena.&quot;A July hospital survey from JPMorgan last week has heightened concerns about insurers' spending on patients' medical claims in the third quarter. Anthem Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Centene Corp. were among the companies that flagged rising costs in the past quarter,&quot; according to Bloomberg.And to make matters worse, the next round of Democratic debates is just a few weeks away, so at a time when UNH should be steady due to its defensive posture, the shares are under siege on multiple fronts. Grounded For TodayShares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have recently been hot, but the stock lost 1.19% today, which was mostly the symptom of broader market declines, not a lawsuit out of Russia that, justifiably so, did not unnerve investors.&quot;Avia Capital Services, a subsidiary of state-owned Russian conglomerate Rostec, is suing Boeing to cancel 737 MAX orders,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Avia isn't listed specifically in Boeing's commercial orders database, probably because it is classified as a lessor or an unidentified client. Boeing had no comment on the lawsuit.&quot;Russia is a minor market for Boeing, and the thing for Boeing investors to focus on over the near-term isn't Russia, but the company's progress on getting the 737 MAX airborne again before the end of 2019. Apple AnglesShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined 0.71% amid reports that Huawei Technologies took some smartphone market share from the iPhone maker in China due to &quot;nationalistic buying&quot; attributable to the U.S.-China trade war.Still, many market participants remain bullish on Apple with some technical analysts saying if the stock moves through the $215 area, upside from there could be significant. Bottom Line on Dow JonesUnderscoring the still defensive tone to the market this month, gold is getting more and more attention, though the yellow metal was mostly sluggish today.&quot;The surge in demand for gold comes as global market uncertainty has risen in response to the imposition of new U.S. sanctions on Iran as well as growing certainty of more Fed rate hikes this year,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;Expectations of lower long-term interest rates and the resulting weaker dollar are both contributing to gold's strength.&quot;Adding to the allure of defensive positions is growing concern that the German economy, the Eurozone's largest, is nearing or in a recession.

NFLX stock has fallen more than 20% since the beginning of July due to poor second quarter results and competition on the horizon. However, now could be a great time to buy the dip -- if you believe this is only short-term weakness, this is an excellent entry point for Netflix stock.Source: Flickr via Mike K. NFLX Stock Sinks After Q2 MissIt can't be ignored that NFLX failed to deliver in the second quarter. The firm's results showed that the number international subscribers rose by 2.8 million, but U.S. subscriber figures were 126,000 lower. Those figures were worrying for a few reasons. First -- they came in significantly below expectations. Analysts were expecting to see international subscriptions rise by 4.8 million and domestic subscriptions rise by 352,000. That's a staggering miss, and it's unlike Netflix stock to come in so far below predictions.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects The second reason those figures were such a problem for investors to digest was the fact that international subscription growth simply isn't that profitable for NFLX.  In the U.S., 64.2% of the total membership fees is being spent on marketing and sales activities. Internationally that percentage is much higher at 86%. That means that international growth isn't actually helping Netflix's bottom line much -- so growth abroad isn't exactly offsetting losses in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Competition The other reason NFLX stock is down in the dumps right now is the threat of powerful incoming competition to the streaming space. Netflix has been able to fend off competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for years, but things are about to get tougher as several deep-pocketed rivals are due to enter the streaming space over the next few months.Disney (NYSE:DIS) is the biggest concern for investors at the moment as the media conglomerate not only has a huge arsenal of popular content behind it, but the firm has years of experience and a ton of cash at its disposal as it rolls out its Disney+ streaming service. Disney also owns a majority of Hulu and will be packaging its services together. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another worrisome competitor set to debut a streaming service before the year is out, and AT&T's (NYSE:T) control of HBO has created another fearsome opponent. The timing of Netflix's earnings miss couldn't be worse with a slew of rival services set to debut over the next few months. Potential Upside for NFLXI'll admit the subscriber losses are troubling and couldn't have come at a worse time for NFLX stock. However, I think it's worth taking a step back and considering the possibility that the huge pullback in Netflix stock could be an overreaction. For one thing, Q2 is historically a bad quarter for Netflix, and some of the weakness can be explained by seasonality and a lack of new content releases.As far as competition goes, most agree that there is room for a few streaming services in the industry as the majority of people subscribe to more than one. Right now, it's unclear exactly how many can co-exist and what people will be willing to pay for their memberships. Netflix currently relies on its membership fees rather than advertising dollars, but that could change if the firm finds that price increases are causing an exodus of users. Content is KingNetflix has become known for its library of quality content -- most of which has been produced by the firm itself. Ultimately, though price will certainly factor into which streaming services people sign up for, content is what will drive their decisions and keep them tied into one service over another.Netflix has a slight edge here because the firm already has a great deal of data from its users about what works and how to create content they're engaged with. That's certainly worth something as we gear up for a streaming showdown. The Bottom Line for Netflix StockThere's no hiding the fact that NFLX stock's Q2 was bad. A drop in U.S. subscribers is terrible no matter how you slice it, but the question here is whether or not this is an indication of a larger problem.Netflix's third-quarter results will make or break a Netflix stock comeback. According to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Matthew Thornton, Q3 appears to be off to a strong start. July data showed that searches for &quot;Netflix&quot; are on the rise and the firm's mobile app downloads are also higher, suggesting that the firm could make a comeback. If you already own NFLX stock, I certainly wouldn't rush out to sell as I believe the firm's strong position in the streaming space makes it a good long-term bet. However, be prepared for some turbulence as new rivals make traders jittery.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow NFLX results are likely to be highly scrutinized over the next few quarters as investors try to suss out whether the competition is affecting Netflix's growth potential. There's also the potential for a sizable upward bounce in the coming months if Q3 proves naysayers wrong and the firm delivers a rebound in subscriber numbers.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long NFLX, AMZN and T.

The shares are up almost 22% in the last year, 82% over the last two years and 130% over the last five. It delivers a small, but steady dividend that has doubled over the last five years.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco's reputation as the best place to buy goods in bulk is reflected in its financial statements, where net income usually comes close to the amount it generates in membership fees. The stores are usually running at break-even.I have owned Costco shares, but sold them a few years ago, thinking they were overpriced. I worried that Costco was running out of places to grow, as young people moved into small city apartments the company doesn't serve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI was wrong. So far in 2019 Costco shareholders have done better than those at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or even Amazon. Communist? Or Conservative?Costco is unique among retailers not just in that it pays its line employees well, but in that it doesn't overpay managers. Employees are thus more satisfied with their pay and working conditions at Costco than employees at any other company -- even those at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).But Costco is also conservative, in the best possible way. It can cost as much as $100 million to outfit a new store, so it usually rolls out just one or two each month. Its stores are all located in upper-middle class suburbs, with ample parking, gas stations and tire centers. It is the last great suburban success story. Unlike Walmart, it doesn't suck up the whole retail market, it just skims the cream off its top.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Costco has no secrets. Management admits its focus is on customers and employees, not just shareholders. Its stock is limited to a few items in each category, and its markups average just 15%, against 25-50% markups from other retailers. The company's Kirkland store brand often offers better quality than the national brands it competes with. Costco was late to online shopping, but its app is already considered better than that of Walmart's Sam's Club.During the era of President Donald Trump, which has benefitted upper-income suburbanites most, Costco's growth has accelerated. Sales for the first three quarters of 2019 are up 6.5% overall, and online sales are up almost 25%. During the current fiscal year, it has paid back over one-quarter of its long-term debt, nearly $1.7 billion, despite super-low interest rates.  Can Costco Stock Continue?There are indications that finally, Costco is running out of growth. Neighborhoods and local governments are fighting new stores in some wealthy neighborhoods.Costco's profits accelerated after it switched from using an American Express (NYSE:AXP) to a Citicorp (NYSE:C) by Visa (NYSE:V) card, as did benefits to cardholders. But that's a trick that is hard to repeat.Costco is growing internationally and opened its first store in Shanghai this month. Currently 68% of its stores are in the U.S., but that will change as it rolls out executive memberships in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Costco's growth has been decelerating slowly in 2019, into the mid-single digits each month, as its fiscal 2018 revenue came to $141 billion. The Bottom Line on COST StockCostco stock is an investment, not a trade. Costco is managed conservatively for the long run. Even if the stores look cookie-cutter, they don't open until after years of careful planning. Risks are growing. A higher international profile means there are now currency risks, trade risks and social dislocation risks. Even Walmart has had its misadventures in growing globally.But, as I said at the outset, I was a fool to sell my shares. Hang on to yours.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

The overall damage to the company will be a âlittle lessâ than billionaire founder Ren Zhengfeiâs initial estimate, Xu added.Huawei is seeking to develop alternatives after coming under intense pressure from the Trump Administration, which has argued its technology represents a security threat. On Friday, it introduced its most powerful artificial intelligence chipset, the Ascend 910, which is poised to rival some of the best offerings from Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Earlier this month, it offered the first glimpse of an in-house software -- HarmonyOS -- that may someday replace Googleâs Android.The company is also researching ways to replace chip-design software tools offered by Cadence and Synopsys, Xu told a news briefing in Shenzhen without elaborating. âThere were no chip design tools 10 years ago, but the industry still developed chips,â said Xu, who argued that Cadence and Synopsys were not must-haves for design. âIntel started to develop chips in the 1970s, when those companies didnât exist.âSince May, Huawei has occupied the uncomfortable position of being both an established global brand and a member of the U.S. Entity List, which bars it from trading freely with American suppliers. Despite a series of 90-day reprieves, the latest of which came this week, the uncertainty caused by American sanctions has already cost the company a great deal.Even if Huawei is eventually brought in from the cold, the impact of this summerâs upheaval will be widespread and painful. Already, it reported slower sales growth in the second quarter compared to the first as the ban started to bite, especially into a consumer business encompassing smartphones and laptops. That in turn is accelerating Huaweiâs effort to become self-reliant.One area in which the Chinese company is rapidly developing in-house expertise is semiconductors, propelling Beijingâs ambitions of weaning itself off foreign chips. HiSilicon -- Huaweiâs chip design subsidiary -- has been developing its capabilities for a long time, and itâs recently grown into the second largest customer (after Apple Inc.) for the worldâs biggest chip manufacturing contractor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Huawei has also elevated the presence of home-grown technologies throughout its product line -- from base stations to smartphones and servers -- as a key step to limiting the damage of the U.S. ban.The Ascend 910 processor unveiled Friday is a show of technological prowess. It will be used for AI model training, and Huawei says it outperforms all existing competition. Xu proclaimed that âwithout a doubt, it has more computing power than any other AI processor in the world.â The company also unveiled MindSpore, an AI computing framework that -- along with the 910 -- is supposedly twice as fast as Googleâs TensorFlow.âThe May 16 sanctions incident had no impact on the execution of Huaweiâs AI strategy nor commercialization of AI products,â said Xu. âOur R&D project related to AI is building up steadily.â(Updates with Ascendâs specs from the third paragraph)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-23,202.64,206.49,3.85,0.01899921,Don't move,1,18,578,20,3.4602076124567476

Thereâs no guarantee the three judges who considered Qualcommâs request will be on the panel hearing the appeal in JanuaryU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh found in May that Qualcommâs âno license, no chipsâ policy unfairly leveraged the companyâs market position to force customers to pay inflated prices for chips and royalties for their technology. She ordered the company to end the policy and renegotiate some of its contracts.Read More: Judgeâs Conundrum: Is Qualcomm a Monopolist, or Merely a Bully?Qualcomm has argued that Kohâs order would undermine its entire business. Under the original ruling, the company would be forced to renegotiate patent-licensing contracts with phone makers, a process that could slash its largest source of profit. It would create binding arrangements that wouldnât be reversed, even if Qualcomm got the ruling overturned on appeal.The San Diego-based chipmaker is unusual in the chip industry because it gets the majority of its profit from fees on patents that cover the fundamentals of how modern phone systems work. Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and all of the worldâs biggest phone makers have to pay whether or not they use its chips. That arrangement has caused intense legal fights and regulatory scrutiny around the world for Qualcomm.The case has split the U.S. government, especially the two agencies charged with antitrust matters. While the FTC -- an independent agency -- argued that Qualcomm harmed competition, the U.S. Justice Department said Kohâs ruling harmed consumers.Qualcomm also got the backing of other areas of the Trump administration, as both the Defense Department and Department of Energy said the order threatens national security and Americaâs lead role in 5G, the next-generation of wireless technology that promises to transform everything from robotic surgery to autonomous vehicles.âWhether the district courtâs order and injunction represent a trailblazing application of the antitrust laws, or instead an improper excursion beyond the outer limits of the Sherman Act, is a matter for another day,â the appeals panel said, referring to the federal antitrust law.The language of the ruling has improved Qualcommâs chance of winning the appeal or reaching a settlement with the agency, said Jennifer Rie, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Ankur Kapoor, an antitrust lawyer with Constantine Cannon in New York whoâs not involved in the case, said the panelâs detailed ruling may be an attempt to âexplain their thinkingâ in a case with high stakes for the company. He said the court wanted to maintain the status quo, especially considering the potential impact to Qualcommâs long-term business and the fact that the appeal is being expedited, with a decision expected shortly after January arguments.In some ways, Qualcommâs licensing program âappears significantly impaired regardlessâ because of the legal strains on the company and the slowdown in the âhorrendousâ chip market, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research.FTC âDisappointedâFTC Bureau of Competition Director Bruce Hoffman said he was disappointed in the courtâs ruling and noted that only part of the courtâs ruling was put on hold. Qualcomm still canât enter into exclusive deals on modem chips, canât interfere with any customerâs ability to communicate with government agencies and must submit to monitoring, which the FTC said promotes competition. Qualcomm didnât ask the appeals court to put those aspects on hold.âThe Bureau of Competition will monitor Qualcommâs conduct relating to the on-going injunctive provisions, and we stand ready to evaluate any information from industry participants relating to whether Qualcomm is complying with its obligations,â Hoffman said.The court order previews some of the arguments that Qualcomm is expected to make when it files its written arguments with the Ninth Circuit later Friday. Qualcomm will argue that Koh stretched the definition of antitrust rules under U.S. law and ignored evidence that showed there was competition.Koh had no right to decide that Qualcommâs rates were unreasonable, order the company to give licenses to its competitors or decide whether or not it has to supply chips to handset makers, the San Diego-based company contends.The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm, 17-220, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit (San Francisco).To contact the reporters on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Steve StrothFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-22,212.46,202.64,-9.82,-0.046220465,Sell,2,21,814,25,3.0712530712530715

As I noted on Thursday, Powell's comments from the Jackson Hole economic conference today took on added importance after the FOMC minutes out earlier this week indicated the July rate cut doesn't mean more are coming. A pair of Fed governors affirmed that notion Thursday.Put simply, Powell's Wyoming remarks weren't dovish enough for the president or markets as evidenced by Friday's tumble. Trump pondered on Twitter &quot;My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSpeaking of China, the world's second-largest economy is promising new tariffs on U.S. goods, an overture to which Trump had plenty to say.&quot;The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP,&quot; said the president on Twitter. &quot;Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing .your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China's Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States. Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn't. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!&quot;All of that conjecture gets us to a glum end of the week with Nasdaq Composite sinking 3% while the S&P 500 lost 2.59%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.37%. In late trading, just one Dow stock was in the green: Boeing (NYSE:BA). Too Many Losers on the DowIn late trading, 19 of the 29 Dow offenders were lower by 2% or more, underscoring just how bad of day it was for equities. Among those losers were plenty of tariff-sensitive names, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which was the worst performer in the Dow today with a loss of 4.62%.In other news, it's hard to get excited about a stock like Nike (NYSE:NKE) on a day when trade tensions surge and Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) plunges on bad earnings. Shares of Nike reflected as much with a Friday slide of 3.33%, but at least one analyst defended the athletic apparel giant. Guggenheim named Nike to its &quot;best ideas&quot; list today.The research firm said &quot;the company is positioned well to maneuver through tariff risks, and that Nike's latest earnings and robust product pipeline were impressive. Also of note, Nike has joined 31 other major retailers in signing a pact for better environmental efforts, which will be presented at this weekend's Group of Seven (G-7) summit,&quot; according to Schaeffer's Investment Research.In the search for good news today, one that was difficult as it pertains to members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, another tidbit I have to offer up is Betsy Graseck, global head of banks and diversified finance research at Morgan Stanley, making some bullish comments on Dow components American Express (NYSE:AXP) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) in an interview with Barron's.Graseck highlighted JPM's big buybacks as earnings booster and the ability of American Express to weather a recession thanks to its more affluent clientele.In other glum news, oil prices traded lower and already-struggling shares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) were hit wit a downward price target revision with UBS paring its forecast on the stock to $75 from $87. That new target still implies some decent upside from today's close for the largest domestic oil company. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayI don't like sounding alarm bells, but the president's comments directed toward China today are very hard to retract. To be fair, he's on point when it comes to the fentanyl issue, but ordering U.S. companies to stop manufacturing in China is a gambit that will not bear fruit anytime soon.This trade war, now reaching new, ominous heights, is likely to stoke recession speculation. The only good news there is that the Fed will likely attempt intervention via rate cuts.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

861,1798,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airpods-maker-sales-surge-79-100000860.html?.tsrc=rss,"AirPods Maker Sales Surge 79%, With More Growth Expected",2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Luxshare Precision Industry Co. drew a series of analyst price upgrades after the Chinese assembler of Apple Inc.âs AirPods revealed a roughly 80% surge in first-half profit and sales.The company, regarded as a bellwether for Chinaâs consumer hardware industry, is expected to become an increasingly important supplier of components for wearable devices like the Apple Watch, some analysts say. Goldman, CICC and Morgan Stanley were among the investment houses that lifted their stock price target on the consumer hardware firm after it posted results late Tuesday.Luxshare is among the largest of a crop of Chinese manufacturers of consumer electronics thatâre increasingly winning orders from longer-established firms like Foxconn Technology Group. The Shenzhen-based firm has in past years become a primary supplier of AirPods, one of the fastest-selling consumer accessories in the market. TF International analyst Kuo Ming-chi estimates AirPod shipments could rise 60%-70% for 2019, and 50%-60% for 2020.âLuxshare is in a fast-growth phase thanks to its comprehensive product lines and expertise in R&D and production of precision electronic components, which provide a defensive moat,â Csc International analyst Zhu Jixiang said. âAppleâs AirPods in particular are a bright spot in the market, and Luxshare has a significant share of assembling that product.âLuxshareâs stock slid 2% on Wednesday but Bright Smart Securities analyst Mark Huang blamed that partly on a conservative projection for current-quarter net income growth of 18% to 38%. Huang said any losses presented a buying opportunity.Only 1 of 32 analysts covering the company rated it a sell, according to Bloomberg-compiled data (the rest were Buys). Its blended 12-month price-earnings ratio of 27 compared with an average of 24 for the past two years.âLuxshare again produced a solid set of numbers. Any back-sliding in the stock presents a chance to buy,â Bright Smartâs Huang said. âTodayâs fall may stem from a temporary valuation adjustment, after a portion of capital chose to lock in profits.âRead more: Trump Tumult Has Gadget Giants Splitting Along U.S.-China LinesAnalystsâ optimism aside, the Chinese company itself warned Tuesday about the uncertain impact of global trade ructions.Trump-administration tariffs on Chinese-made products, including eventually a swathe of consumer and mobile electronics, will pressure contract manufacturersâ margins and accelerate a costly shift of capacity away from China over time . An economic downturn could also depress demand for electronics more generally.Luxshare can counter some of those headwinds due to its strong capability of manufacturing precision instruments and expectations of new wave of 5G-driven demand, Huang said.âIts growth prospects will expand in the 5G era, along with demand for mobile peripherals,â he said.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Ludi Wang in Shanghai at lwang191@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Charlie ZhuFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-21,212.64,212.46,-0.18,-0.000846501,Don't move,2,33,467,37,7.922912205567452

But, from essentially 2010 to 2019, there have really only been three viable streaming TV services -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video, and Hulu -- all of which cost a very cheap ~$10 per month.As such, contrary to what the headlines will lead you to believe, cord-cutters have been the exception. Most households in the U.S. have a Netflix subscription. Most households also still pay for cable TV. In other words, the consumption shift from linear to internet TV in the 2010's has been defined largely by consumers bundling pay TV packages and streaming services together -- not by wholesale cord-cutting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat's about to change in 2020. A plethora of new streaming TV services are going to launch in late 2019 and 2020. Most of these streaming TV services project to be really good. Pretty much all of them will feature exclusive content.The introduction of these new services will truly kick-start the cord-cutting trend. By 2025, I don't think many households in the U.S. will be paying for cable TV. Instead, I think most households will bundle together several streaming packages at a cost that's similar to what they paid for cable, but with a lot more content and enhanced convenience. Deloitte agrees, saying that as early by the end of 2020, 20% of adults in developed economies will be paying for 10 digital media subscription services. * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More What's the investment implication here? Buy streaming TV stocks. The streaming TV gold rush that will play out in the 2020's will create a rising tide that will lift most boats in this segment. Streaming TV Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX)Source: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com Streaming Service(s): NetflixIndustry pioneer and leader Netflix is widely seen as a big loser with the oncoming onslaught of competitive streaming TV services from the rest of the media industry.But, this fear seems overstated to me. Netflix will be just fine. As mentioned earlier, the norm by 2025 will be multiple streaming TV subscriptions per household. Probably somewhere around four to five. An over-the-top complete TV package like YouTube TV or AT&T TV will likely be one of them, since consumers still have huge demand for live TV. That leaves three to four open spots. So, when all is said and done, all Netflix needs to be is a top three to four streaming service.Netflix will inevitably be that. The core value prop of Netflix is the original content. Original content streaming hours as a percent of total streaming hours on Netflix has risen from 14% in January 2017, to 24% in October 2017 to 37% in October 2018. Bears will say that the bulk of viewing hours are still allocated for licensed content. I'd argue that the trend implies that by the time Netflix loses its licensed content (2020/21), the percent of viewing hours dedicated to original content will be north of 50%.Thus, contrary to what the bears will have you believe, the original content strategy is working here. Netflix subscribers are watching more and more Netflix originals, and they are liking them, too (a hefty portion of Netflix originals score really well on IMDb). This strategy will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Netflix has huge data and resource advantages. They have more viewership data than anyone else in this space, and they also spend more money on content than anyone else.Net net, Netflix will be just fine in the wake of intensified streaming TV competition. The platform will continue to add subs at a record rate during the streaming TV gold rush of the early 2020's, and NFLX stock will march higher. Disney (DIS)Source: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.com Streaming Service(s): Disney+ (launching November 2019), ESPN+ and HuluPerhaps the one company that investors and consumers are most excited about with regards to its streaming TV market entry is global media giant Disney (NYSE:DIS).Streaming TV isn't brand new for Disney. The company launched EPSN+, a streaming extension of ESPN, in 2018. The company has also long held a stake in streaming platform Hulu, and now owns the entire service. But, those two services pale in comparison to the forthcoming launch of Disney's branded streaming service and true competitor to Netflix -- Disney+.Disney+ will do really well. As stated in the Netflix segment, all Disney+ has to be is a top three to four streaming service to be successful at scale. That means all Disney+ needs is to have a top three to four content library in the streaming TV world. The platform will inevitably have that, given that Disney owns a treasure chest of content dating back several decades and that the company consistently dominates the box office every single year.Further, Disney is offering a package that bundles Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu together. That package should do very well, because it checks off every entertainment type -- great movies with Disney+, live sports with ESPN+ and great shows with Hulu. * 11 Stocks Under $10 to Buy Now Net net, Disney's streaming TV push over the next several years will yield hugely positive results, led by Disney+ turning into one of the biggest streaming TV services in the world. As this happens, DIS stock will naturally rally as cord-cutting headwinds become old news and as profits start marching higher with a consistently robust pace. Apple (AAPL)Source: Shutterstock Streaming Service(s): Apple TV+ (launching November 2019)Another company which both investors and consumers are excited about with regards to its streaming TV market entry in late 2019 is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).The big story at Apple is pretty simple. Over a decade ago, the genius known as Steve Jobs came up with the iPhone. That small gadget changed the world. Ever since, Apple has sold a ton of iPhones to a ton of consumers everywhere and Apple's revenues, profits and market cap have exploded higher.But, the hardware growth narrative has largely run its course. That is, pretty much everyone who wants a smartphone, already has a smartphone. Thus, Apple is looking for alternative revenue streams to sustain growth in the absence of robust hardware growth.The biggest of these alternative revenue streams? Software. Specifically, because Apple has sold so many iPhones over the past decade-plus, the company has a huge opportunity to monetize the world's largest hardware install base through various subscription software services like a streaming music service, a curated news service, a cloud storage service so on and so forth.The most promising of these services? A streaming TV service dubbed Apple TV+, which is set to launch in November 2019.The big question marks for Apple TV+ revolve around content. Apple hasn't ever produced TV shows or movies before. But, the company has a ton of cash it can spend to attract top talent, and top talent usually makes strong content that consumers are willing to pay for.Thus, given Apple's huge resources, Apple TV+ does project as a top three to four streaming TV service at scale, meaning that Apple TV+ could be set to add tens of millions of subs over the next few years. If so, that software revenue growth bump will provide a lift to AAPL stock. AT&T (T)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com Streaming Service(s): AT&T TV, DirectTV Now and HBO Max (Spring 2020)The dark horse in the streaming TV gold rush is telecom and media giant AT&T (NYSE:T). But, because AT&T's streaming TV potential is presently so understated, I actually think AT&T stock could be one of the biggest winners in the streaming TV gold rush of the early 2020's.The idea here is simple. AT&T -- much like Disney -- has struggled with cord-cutting for the past several years. Those headwinds have kept a lid on AT&T stock. Also much like Disney, AT&T is attempting to remedy those headwinds with a forthcoming big push into the streaming TV arena. AT&T is set to launch both AT&T TV (an over-the-top TV package that is basically cable, but cheaper and in the streaming format) and HBO Max (an HBO-focused streaming service with additional WarnerMedia content) soon.Unlike Disney stock, though, AT&T stock has not benefited from a major uptick over the past few quarters in anticipation of this streaming TV push. This disconnect is an opportunity.Both AT&T TV and HBO Max will be huge. As more streaming services rush to the forefront, consumers will increasingly look to cut the cord. But, they will still want to watch live TV. AT&T TV will allow them to do that, at a fraction of the cost of cable. Thus, AT&T TV will become the de-facto live TV replacement in the streaming world.At the same time, HBO Max is equipped with enough content firepower from HBO and WarnerMedia to compete pound-for-pound with industry heavyweights Netflix, Amazon and Disney. * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale In total, then, AT&T's streaming TV push over the next few years could be tremendously successfully. Tremendous success on the streaming TV front isn't priced into dirt-cheap AT&T stock today. As such, the potential upside in AT&T stock from the streaming TV gold rush is quite compelling. Roku (ROKU)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Streaming Service(s): All of them.When it comes to the streaming TV gold rush, perhaps the best way to play the trend is to buy shares of streaming device maker and service aggregator Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU).Plain and simple -- Roku is becoming the cable box of the streaming TV world. That is, the streaming TV world in 2025 will look a lot like the linear TV world of 2015. There will be a whole bunch of streaming services (which are basically just different &quot;channels&quot;). There will also be a ton of consumers trying to access those streaming services. Thus, there will be an increasing need for someone to step in and act like a cable box -- connecting all that demand to all the supply in seamless manner.Roku does that. They also do it better than anyone else for several reasons. First, they are content neutral, so every service can be accessed without friction and bias. Second, they have the most intuitive UI, which consumers broadly understand and love. Third, they dominate the smart TV market, with one out of every three smart TVs in the U.S. last quarter being a Roku TV. Fourth, their separate set-boxes are dirt cheap.Given these factors, Roku is not just the cable box of the streaming TV world today. But, they project to remain the cable box of the streaming TV world for a lot longer, too. As such, this platform will grow with the entire streaming TV industry for the next several years. All that growth will inevitably push ROKU stock higher in the long run.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX, AMZN, DIS, T and ROKU.

I mentioned earlier this week that some of the more important European economies, including Germany, are on the cusp of economic contractions and that are likely to spur the European Central Bank (ECB) into action.That was one catalyst for today's rally: talk that the ECB won't be sitting on the sidelines much longer and will attempt something with monetary policy aimed at perking up the region's sagging economies.Here in the U.S., it still seems like a stretch to say that a recession is imminent, but the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reading out today could be cause for concern for fans of President Donald Trump. That survey indicates independent and republican voters are growing concerned about the economy and could be apt to rein in spending. That data point was revealed just a day after the president spoke glowingly about the economy and the strength of the American consumer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On Even with all the recession chatter, the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.67% while the S&P 500 climbed 1.44%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the week with a gain of 1.20%. Fun fact, at least for day traders or those that like volatility: the S&P 500 has had intraday moves of at least 1% for nearly three straight trading weeks. Tariff TalkThese days, it's almost possible to discuss stocks, particularly many of the Dow members, with talking about tariffs. Plenty of stocks are more tariff-sensitive than others, and JPMorgan was talking about a few of those names today.Remember that while President Trump backed off some of the tariffs on Chinese goods set to go into effect on Sept. 1, he did not back off all of those levies. And the ones not going into effect next month were not eliminated. Those were merely delayed until mid-December.As for companies likely to be affected by the Sept.1 tariffs, those names include Dow components Dow (NYSE:DOW) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Somehow, Dow, the chemicals maker, was the second-best performer in the Dow today while industrial machinery maker Caterpillar was a solid gainer as well, adding 0.97%.Regarding Dow members that could be pinched by the December tariffs, assuming those penalties go into effect, JPMorgan includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) on that list. However, both stocks closed higher today.The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has been receiving elevated trade-related mentions, according to JPMorgan. Still, Home Depot is a heavily domestic company and the shares added 0.92% today ahead of next Tuesday's earnings report. Bad Bank Stocks on the DowEach of the Dow's financial services components, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank, closed higher today. I mention this because, yes, banks are being drilled by declining net interest margin expectations at the hands of lower interest rates, but also because recent price action in the sector confirms investors can be confounded by analyst chatter.Just last week, a Wells Fargo analyst said valuations on bank stocks are attractive, but today the same analyst said &quot;there is no way to sugar coat the negative impact of lower interest rates&quot; on banks' net interest margins and per share earnings.As I pointed out a couple of times during financial services earnings season, the net interest margin issued was raised on a slew of bank earnings calls and at this point, should be baked into these stocks. Dow Jones Bottom LineWith all the aforementioned recession chatter swirling, the good news is that the Federal Reserve will not take that talk lightly and it is becoming increasingly likely that there could be another two rate cuts before the end of this year.While that may be good news, the risk is that with rates already so low by historical standards, the effectiveness of more rate reductions may not be up to investors' current expectations. Time will tell on that front, but the near-term path of least resistance would be for trade wars to cease.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

891,1902,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/touch-screens-cars-don-t-182325342.html?.tsrc=rss,Touch-Screens in Cars Donât Make Us Safer âÂ Yet,2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Two years ago, 10 sailors died when the U.S. Navyâs guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with a chemical tanker off Singapore. An investigation has determined that insufficient training and inadequate operating procedures were to blame, and both factors were related to a new touch-screen-based helm control system. The Navy has decided to revert its destroyers back to entirely physical throttles and helm controls.Itâs worth exploring the Navyâs rationale for installing touch-screens (âJust because you can doesnât mean you should,â says Rear Admiral Bill Galinis), as well as its rationale for getting rid of them:Galinis said that bridge design is something that shipbuilders have a lot of say in, as itâs not covered by any particular specification that the Navy requires builders to follow. As a result of innovation and a desire to incorporate new technology, âwe got away from the physical throttles, and that was probably the number-one feedback from the fleet â they said, just give us the throttles that we can use.âThere are lessons here â including a prescient one from 50 years ago â for other, more mundane transport-control interfaces as well.Large, interactive touch-screens are becoming increasingly prevalent in passenger cars; in the case of Tesla, theyâre the only control interface. Theyâre lovely to look at, but as the Navyâs experience suggests, they might be more confusing than physical controls. That confusion isnât academic, either: Distracted driving is an increasingly dangerous problem. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 10% of all fatal crashes from 2012 to 2017 involved distracted drivers. Mobile phones are a major cause of distraction, as weâd expect, but theyâre an even bigger problem for younger drivers.Almost 50 years ago, robotics professor Masahiro Mori wrote an extraordinary essay, âThe Uncanny Valley,â on peopleâs reactions to robots as they became more and more humanlike. As Mori said, our affinity for robots rises as they more closely resemble humans. That affinity plunges, becoming negative and finally rising again once a robot reaches the (possibly unattainable) full likeness of a human being.Something similar is at work in our current touch-screen-filled vehicles. To an extent, adding more screen real estate give us more information, and with it more safety â until it begins to provide an overwhelming amount of information and an overly complex set of choices for visual navigation. And moving from one information-rich interface to another is increasingly difficult, as another Navy rear admiral said in reviewing the John S. McCain collision:When you look at a screen, where do you find heading? Is it in the same place, or do you have to hunt every time you go to a different screen? So the more commonality we can drive into these kind of human-machine interfaces, the better it is for the operator to quickly pick up what the situational awareness is, whatever aspect heâs looking at, whether itâs helm control, radar pictures, whatever. So weâre trying to drive that.There are two ways our in-car screens could evolve. The first is that, for safetyâs sake, theyâll move back down the curve, so to speak, and be less ambiguous and more full of knobs and dials and physical throttles. Thatâs the Navyâs new approach. The second, though, is that we wonât go back, at least in passenger applications, to a more tactile interface of specific controls. Weâre probably going to get more screens, with more information. Maybe the only way out of this valley is to shift the interface completely to voice or, in the very long run, to obviate the issue by having cars drive themselves. That could be how we navigate this uncanny valley of vehicle interfaces â the removal of any need to control the vehicle at all, and the chance to fill our carsâ screens with pure entertainment.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday.Source: Anna Hoychuk / Shutterstock.com Watch Series 5: A new rumor claims that Japan Display is going to supply OLED screens for the next Watch, reports MacRumors. This rumor says that the Apple Watch Series 5 will feature displays from the Japanese company. However, it also notes that LG will also be supplying some of the OLED panels for the wearable. If these rumors are true, then it looks like AAPL is looking to spread out its supply chain some.iPhone 11 Display: Rumor has it that Apple is going to use a Samsung OLED screen for the iPhone 11, BGR notes. This rumor claims that it will be the same display that is in the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10. AAPL getting displays from Samsung isn't new, but using the same displays as a competing device is. Typically, the company has its own custom displays for its devices. The rumor points out that two smartphones in the iPhone 11 line will make use of OLED screens.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHomePod Japan: Apple is preparing to finally bring the HomePod to Japan, reports 9to5Mac. The HomePod will officially be available in Japan starting on August 23. However, customers that want to guarantee they get one can preorder starting today. It will cost 32,800 yen, which is about the same as its $299 price in the U.S. The launch in Japan comes two years after the HomePod made its debut in the U.S.Subscribe to Apple Rumors As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Friday Apple Rumors: Japan Display May Supply OLED for Watch Series 5 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",2019-08-15,201.74,206.5,4.76,0.023594726,Buy,11,9,308,31,10.064935064935066
895,1906,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-looking-ripe-picking-145204271.html?.tsrc=rss,Apple Stock Is Looking Ripe for the Picking At $200,2019-08-15,"Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have certainly fallen hard along with the rest of the market over the past few weeks. Apple stock is now down nearly 10% from the recent highs despite good earnings and a better outlook from the recent earnings report. While growth is undoubtedly slowing, AAPL is now nearing levels that make it comparatively attractive on both a fundamental and yield basis. Time to take a bite out of Apple.Source: Shutterstock Apple reported earnings on July 30 and beat expectations on both the top and bottom line. Earnings came in at $2.18 per share, well above the consensus for $2.10 per share. Revenue also was a beat at $53.8 billion versus expectations for $53.4 billion. Most importantly, Apple raised guidance to a range of $61 to $64 billion. Previously the company guided to just $60.98 billion.As expected, the initial reaction was positive with AAPL stock trading past $220 following the release. Since then, however, Apple stock has given back all those gains and more. AAPL stock now sits at $200, a big pullback from those $220 highs of only 8 trading days ago.  This despite the solid earnings beat and raised guidance. To me, the combination of better earnings and a cheaper stock price makes AAPL a much more attractive buy than it was just a month ago.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple stock now sports a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15.6, well below the forward multiple of 18.2 for the S&P 500. The dividend yield of 1.5% is not that far below the 1.64% yield on the 10 year Treasuries. Lower multiple stocks with a decent dividend are a good place to hunker down during these periods of market turmoil.The technicals also point to a potential pop on the horizon for Apple stock. The MACD reached recent lows before turning higher. The five-day RSI got to oversold levels with a reading below 30 before strengthening. Bollinger Percent B also printed negative before getting back to positive territory. Prior instances when these metrics were this oversold marked significant short-term lows in Apple stock.AAPL also held the crucial 100-day moving average at $197.29. AAPL stock still remains above the uptrend line from the lows of last December. Apple Stock ChartAll eyes will be on Apple as it releases the latest iPhone offerings on Sept. 10. The iPhone 11, rumored to be called the iPhone Pro, may likely have a triple lens camera with a square design. It is expected to come in three different screen sizes and have bilateral charging. The impending release date will likely dampen upside for AAPL stock in front of the event, but should be a solid catalyst for a move higher following the official announcement.The recent delay in imposing new tariffs on China by the Trump administration should also provide a more bullish backdrop for AAPL stock in the coming months. Any easing in the trade war tensions may at least help staunch the recent slide in stocks, as the the big rally Tuesday in Apple stock showed. This is especially important for Apple in front of the new product launch next month.Investors should look to add Apple to the portfolio on any move back toward the $200 area. The initial upside price target is the post earnings highs at the $220 level. Selling the Jan $220 covered call for $7 helps to cushion the downside by the premium received while pre-positioning to exit at the target price. A meaningful break of the trend line would be reason to exit AAPL and a good stop out point.Tim Biggam may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

897,1908,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-5g-stocks-buy-stream-153224203.html?.tsrc=rss,5 5G Stocks to Buy That Will Stream Higher Profits for Investors,2019-08-15,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in May 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]As telcos launch the first of the 5G networks, 5G stocks will become a focus. The technology will change wireless. How much speed it will add has become a point of controversy. Estimates from a few years ago predicted that 5G would be 1,000 times as fast as 4G.More recent estimates peg the improvement at 10 to 20 times 4G LTE. Whatever happens after launch, consumers should see a quantum leap in speed and reliability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuch speeds will lead to capabilities not possible today. For this reason, it becomes difficult to know whether innovations will come from one of the large companies or from the mind of an unknown inventor working in his garage.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall Whatever happens, these 5G stocks to buy will likely be among the large companies that lead the way in the new networks, profiting from 5G while trading at reasonable valuations: Apple (AAPL)Although the latest version of the iPhone did not offer 5G capabilities, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will become one of the more prominent 5G stocks in future years. As one of the primary innovators in the wireless market, Apple will likely continue to enjoy a substantial presence in this industry.Source: Shutterstock Warren Buffett has made Apple the largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) portfolio for a reason. AAPL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 14.Also, the stock shows a solid record on dividends. The current yield of 1.50% may not inspire investors. Still, the company has increased its dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 2012. If one keeps AAPL stock as a long-term holding, this dividend will probably become more important.Apple has not yet released a 5G iPhone. However, as soon as it enters the market, the iPhone will become a critical device for 5G service, and AAPL will become one of the more important 5G stocks. Its investors should benefit. AT&T (T)AT&T (NYSE:T) will become only one of three companies, now that it appears as if  T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) will get merger clearance, to offer 5G wireless service. This factor in itself makes AT&T one of the more important 5G stocks. Because of the tens of billions of dollars needed to build such a network, the company will probably not have to deal with additional competitors.Source: Shutterstock The company has struggled recently. Cord-cutting in the pay-TV business, a highly competitive wireless industry, and the costly 5G upgrade have weighed on the company.However, this offers a tremendous advantage to those who want to invest now. The recent struggles of the stock have taken its forward P/E to about 8.7. This comes to less than half of the five-year average P/E of about 18.Still, the biggest reason to invest lies in the dividend. Its annual dividend comes to a yield of ~6%, triple the S&P 500 average of 1.9%.Even better, the psychology that drives T stock insures this dividend will increase. The company has increased its dividend in each of the previous 34 years. For this reason, maintaining the price of T stock hinges heavily on these dividend increases. The increased revenues that will likely come from 5G will also ensure that the company can afford the dividend increases.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul With 5G beginning to become a revenue source, the company's fortunes should improve. Moreover, a single-digit forward P/E and a generous dividend make AT&T one of the more attractive 5G stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Many will remember Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) as the company whose routers helped to provide internet service in the 1990s. Today, CSCO stock behaves more like an old-line industrial than a high-flying tech stock.Source: Shutterstock However, the company still offers critical internet infrastructure. Its products along with the stock's value and rising dividend should make CSCO one of the more compelling 5G stocks.Cisco employs what it calls a &quot;Cloud-to-Client&quot; approach to 5G. The company wants to transform networks end-to-end, making Cisco equipment a critical component in delivering 5G faster. This technology is designed to encompass every aspect of 5G into a seamless network, providing security and enhancing video optimization.In addition to 5G customers, Cisco also offers a compelling value proposition to new investors. Its stock trades at about 16.5 times forward earnings. Analysts expect about 5% revenue growth this year.Also, unlike the Cisco of the 1990s, this company also embraces dividends. Cisco paid its first dividend in 2011, and it has increased these payouts every year since. Today, CSCO stock pays an annual dividend which yields about 2.7%. Hence, Cisco stock offers a reasonable P/E and an above-average dividend yield that will probably rise on a yearly basis. With 5G revenues funding its profits, CSCO stock should hold investors in good stead for years to come. Intel (INTC)As the PC business, which had sustained Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for decades, began its decline, the changing marketplace forced INTC to seek new lines of business.Source: Shutterstock As a result, Intel has embraced 5G by involving itself in the Internet of Things (IoT) and data centers. These two components should make Intel prominent among 5G stocks.Client computing still makes up Intel's largest revenue source. However, data center revenue grew 21% in 2018, compared with only 9% for client computing. The company warned data center growth might slow. Still, its high growth places data center revenue on track to become Intel's largest revenue source within a few years.By most accounts, INTC stock has become a bargain. If the consensus earnings forecast holds, Intel trades at a forward P/E of 9.8, well below the five-year average P/E of 15.75.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Also, the company has paid dividends since 2000. It has increased them in most of the years since, and every year since 2014. Today, this 5G stock maintains a $1.26 per share annual dividend that yields around 2.75%. With a low valuation and a new company identity defined around 5G, I see Intel becoming a popular choice among 5G stocks to buy. Nokia (NOK)Many remember Nokia (NYSE:NOK) as a one-time leader in cell phones before the smartphone pushed its phones aside. As a result, the company redefined itself over the last few years.Source: Shutterstock Although it finally developed its own smartphone, NOK has taken its place among 5G stocks mostly as an equipment provider, furnishing wireless carriers with the hardware necessary to provide 5G services to their customers.Nokia signed a $3.5 billion multi-year agreement with T-Mobile. Under the terms of this deal, Nokia will provide T-Mobile with end-to-end 5G technology, which includes software and services, along with Nokia's hardware. So far, this stands as Nokia's largest 5G deal. I think this will lead to more 5G deals in other countries, bolstering NOK stock.Best of all, I do not think Wall Street yet appreciates the fact that Nokia has redefined itself. Although NOK lost a small amount of money in 2018, the stock looks poised to return to a path of earnings growth in the future. NOK currently trades at about 13 times its estimated 2019 earnings.The company will also pay stockholders well to wait for some appreciation. The company's 24 cents per share annual dividend comes to a yield of about 4%. While this dividend has fluctuated over the years, sustained profit growth makes it more likely the dividend will rise than fall. NOK stock also trades more than 80% below its 2007 high. If it gains more prestige among 5G stocks, I think it could return to its old highs within a few years, or perhaps beyond.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

It also encapsulates a fundamental move of electronics production, set in motion by the escalating U.S.-China trade war, that may hurt the worldâs No. 2 economy while enriching Southeast Asia and beyond.âPegatron, and many more to come, is an opportunity,â Edy Putra Irawady, head of a local agency charged with enticing capital, told the crowd. âBatam has prepared various incentives to chase the opportunity and attract more investment.â Irawady is one of many making preparations for the most profound shift in global manufacturing since the advent of the made-in-China model in the 1980s: its potential dismantling.Trumpâs flip-flops on trade, including a backtracking just this week on threats to slap punishing tariffs on $300 billion of goods, are spurring an exodus from China of manufacturers. Some recognize that U.S.-Chinese tensions wonât fade soon, while others are just tired of the uncertainty. In one of the most dramatic responses since Trump first brandished full tariffs, HP laptop-maker Inventec Corp. declared plans to move its entire U.S.-bound laptop operations from China to its home base of Taiwan within months. âThe trade war is very painful for us,â President Maurice Wu said.Like Pegatron, the makers of the worldâs electronics are increasingly rushing out of the way of Trump-administration tariffs on Chinese-made goods. Server motherboard makers for Google and Amazon.com Inc. are already shifting to Taiwan. Even Apple Inc., whose gargantuan Chinese production machine hires more people than any other private employer, is testing the waters. GoerTek Inc., for one, is trying out production of AirPods in Vietnam, people familiar said. A GoerTek representative declined to comment on the specifics of its Apple business but said the company will gradually make several products in both China and Vietnam.The U.S. presidentâs campaign of tariffs and export restrictions against Chinese champions like Huawei Technologies Co. threatens to up-end the production of the worldâs electronics, from iPhones and laptops to 4K televisions. The decades-old supply chain is starting to split in two: one beyond Chinaâs borders that serves American concerns, and another within the worldâs most populous country that caters to local consumers.Itâs something Foxconnâs billionaire founder, Terry Gou, calls âG2â or the emergence of two competing global standards created by China and the U.S. Gou -- who as Appleâs main production partner helped pioneer the made-in-China model -- has volunteered to âhelp the U.S. reshape a new supply chain.â Young Liu, Gouâs successor, told shareholders the company could make every U.S.-bound iPhone outside of China if it had to.While U.S.-based companies seek alternatives beyond mainland China, their counterparts in China likewise are âde-Americanizingâ their supply chains, reducing their reliance on American core technology for fear they will suffer the same fate as Huawei. The company is now hunting for Asian and European component makers to reduce its dependence on U.S. firms from Google to Micron.In August, Huawei approved Taiwan-based wifi module maker RichWave Technology Corp. to supply parts that U.S. wireless semiconductor company Skyworks used to provide. Analysts including Kevin Chen of Taipei-based President Capital Management say Huawei is increasingly looking to Taiwanâs Win Semiconductors to manufacture radio frequency chips previously supplied by Skyworks and compatriot integrated circuits maker Qorvo.âBoth U.S. and Chinese companies are diversifying their supply chains due to similar reasons -- to mitigate geopolitical risks,â said Gordon Sun, director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Researchâs Macroeconomic Forecasting Center.Mere months ago, it seemed as if China had a virtual lock on the business of making the worldâs electronics -- an arrangement that benefited not just tech juggernauts from Dell Technologies Inc. to HP Inc. but also ensured jobs for millions across the country and fostered the growth of a massive domestic manufacturing industry.While thereâs little chance that China will fully cede its mantle as the worldâs electronics workshop anytime soon, the outward-bound trend is accelerating. Thatâs because the household names that built the technology industryâs global supply chain arenât waiting to see how the conflict turns out.Delta Electronics Inc., which makes power and cooling components for clients like Microsoft Corp. and Huawei, is moving some production back to its home base of Taiwan and to Thailand.

While moving assembly operations is unlike relocating a chip fabrication facility -- arguably the most expensive type of plant at $10 billion or more to set up from scratch -- the cost can run into millions of dollars and entails a plethora of issues from licenses to new regulations and hiring. Thatâs an additional burden that manufacturers with single-digit margins can ill afford.âOur net profit margin stands at a mere 1.4% in the first quarter. The tariffs are 25%.

We simply cannot help our customers absorb those,â Quanta Computer Chairman Barry Lam said in May when talking about potential production shift and tariff impact.Despite Trumpâs proclamations, the U.S. wonât get many of the jobs moving out of China.

903,1914,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-test-more-expensive-subscriptions-090000389.html?.tsrc=rss,Spotify to Test a More Expensive Version of Its Popular Music Service,2019-08-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Spotify Technology SA plans to sell a more-expensive version of its music service in Scandinavia, a test to see whether it can raise prices around the world, according to people familiar with the matter.Spotify will raise the price of its family plan by about 13%, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the increase hasnât been announced. The test doesnât mean Spotify will raise prices elsewhere or do so permanently in Scandinavia, they said. The company declined to comment.Raising prices could boost revenue in markets where Spotify already has a strong presence. The company is based in Stockholm, and its music service is the dominant player across Northern Europe. The current family plan costs about $15 a month and lets up to five people use the service. Spotify has also tested a plan called Premium Duo that offers two subscriptions for 12.49 euros ($13.91) a month.Higher prices might help placate music companies, which have complained about falling revenue per user. Theyâve previously questioned why Spotify doesnât use its market-leading position to raise rates. The average price paid by Spotify subscribers has declined for a few years because of discounts to draw in new customers and growing use of family plans.With 108 million paying customers, Spotify is the largest paid music service in the world, and itâs unlikely to surrender that crown any time soon. The company says itâs growing faster than its closest competitor, Apple Music, which also charges $15 a month for a family plan and had about 60 million customers at midyear.But Spotify still loses money. The company has been reluctant to increase prices because itâs still in a growth stage, relying on discounts to keep customers and attract new ones as people become accustomed to streaming on-demand. While the company has grown quickly, only a minority of music listeners around the world have adopted the technology, and Spotify executives have said the addressable market is at least 1 billion people.Biggest MarketsNorth America, Latin America and Europe account for more than 80% of Spotifyâs customer base. The company is making a big push in Asia, where it has sold its service at low prices to compete with local players and free alternatives such as YouTube.Spotify is also under pressure from competition. It offers more or less the same product as Apple Inc., YouTube and Amazon.com Inc. -- millions of songs available on-demand, as well as playlists and podcasts.But Apple, YouTube and Amazon donât need to make money on music. They can use their music services to profitably sell other products, whether itâs iPhones, advertising or toilet paper. Spotify doesnât have that luxury.To contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-15,201.74,206.5,4.76,0.023594726,Buy,2,39,476,43,9.033613445378151

First-time installs more than quadrupled, pushing the app to the cityâs seventh-most downloaded last month from No. 88 a year earlier, the mobile data provider said. In total, Telegram has been installed 1.7 million times in Hong Kong and 365 million globally.LIHKG, a message board that operates like Reddit, also soared to prominence in Hong Kong due to the protests, which have dogged the international finance hub since anger erupted over a government attempt to pass a bill allowing extraditions to China. There were only 12,000 downloads of the app back in July 2018, but that number soared last month, when it added 120,000 new users, Sensor Tower said.The rapid surge in usage underscores the importance of mobile apps in helping protesters coordinate and spread information about rallies, marches and other actions. Unlike past protests, the current uprising in Hong Kong is bereft of a central leader and instead relies on crowd-sourced opinions and flash mobs that are often organized anonymously on these mobile services.&#92;--With assistance from Matt Turner.To contact the reporter on this story: Shelly Banjo in Hong Kong at sbanjo@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Peter Elstrom at pelstrom@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-15,201.74,206.5,4.76,0.023594726,Buy,1,3,258,5,1.937984496124031

Sign up here.Â Chinese officials are sticking to their plan to visit Washington in September for face-to-face trade meetings, people familiar with the matter said, signaling that talks remain on track for now despite an abrupt escalation in tariff threats this month.The U.S. on Tuesday delayed the imposition of some new tariffs after top negotiators spoke on the phone, with President Donald Trump saying the encounter was âvery productive,â and that he thinks Beijing wants to âdo something dramaticâ to end the impasse.That said, Chinese negotiators are not very optimistic of any imminent progress, one of the people said. Officials are unlikely to make concessions in the run up to October 1, the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Peopleâs Republic, the person said.S&P 500 futures erased their losses, the yen pared gains and the yuan rose slightly on the news. The Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tensions between the worldâs two biggest economies rose significantly this month after Trump said he would tariff another $300 billion of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to halt U.S. agricultural purchases and allow the yuan to weaken. The escalation brought into question whether talks planned for September would still go ahead, with Trump saying itâs &quot;fine&quot; if they donât.Though Trump has often denied his tariffs have any impact on consumer prices and insists their cost is being borne by China, he also said the delay had been made âso it wonât be relevant to the Christmas shopping season.âProspects for genuine progress in trade talks are low, especially as Chinese President Xi Jinping tackles weeks-long protests in Hong Kong that his government blames the U.S. for instigating.Whether or not the talks actually take place also depends on developments between now and then, according to one of the people. The next call between the negotiating teams will be in two weeks.Trumpâs move to delay some tariffs involved the splitting of an almost $300 billion list of products from China into two separate ones. Lots of agricultural products, antiques, clothes, kitchenware and footwear remained on the list to be hit Sept. 1 -- with a total value of more than $110 billion, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of last yearâs import figures.But big-ticket categories such as smart-phones, laptops, and childrenâs toys -- worth about $160 billion -- would only be subject to tariffs after Dec. 15, according to Tuesdayâs announcement. Nearly $2 billion worth of products were removed from the combined lists including bibles and shipping containers.U.S. stocks surged on the news Tuesday. Apple Inc. spiked as much as 5.8% and Best Buy Co. climbed as much as 11% on optimism that the reprieve would boost electronics sales in the holiday season. Apparel retailers including Gap Inc. and L Brands Inc. rose, as did toymaker Hasbro Inc. and discount chain Dollar Tree Inc.The development was greeted in Beijing with some skepticism. Taoran Notes, a blog run by the state-run Economic Daily, wrote on Wednesday that the negotiatorsâ call was made on the invitation of the U.S., indicating that Trump is feeling the pressure of the tariffs.The call sends a âpositive&quot; signal, as it showed that the two sides are still in communication, and are willing to keep in touch, it said. But whether there will be progress or not depends on the U.S.âs actions, according to the blog.&quot;The outside world should have no illusion on Chinaâs positions,â the blog said. &quot;If the U.S. sticks to the maximum pressure tactic, then its goal wonât be reached even if additional tariffs are imposed on all Chinese goods.âTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Steven Yang in Beijing at kyang74@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, ;John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net, Sharon ChenFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-14,202.75,201.74,-1.01,-0.004981504,Don't move,1,16,656,18,2.7439024390243905

The catalyst was a note from the Office of the United States Trade Representative that a new 10% tariff on imported Chinese-produced cell phones would be postponed.Source: Shutterstock While investors cheered the news,  Apple stock still has major risk associated with the ongoing trade war.Investors should understand that the new Dec. 15 tariff deadline is likely now a hard line in the sand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Tariff Threat to Apple Stock Is RealHeadline risk is a tricky thing for an investor. Sometimes the headlines in the media are real issues that affect the real value of a company. Other times, they are just clickbait that spooks traders in the near term. But when it comes to the U.S. trade war with China, the threat to AAPL stock is very real.&quot;If Apple passes through the 10% tariff to consumers, we could see a hit to iPhone demand by roughly 6 million to 8 million iPhones in the US based on our analysis over the next 12 months based on our overall unit forecast of 185 million iPhones globally for FY20,&quot; Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul Ives estimates the postponed tariffs could lower AAPL stock's annual earnings per share by as much as 55 cents, which would be a more than a 4% drop.Apple relies on China so much that trade war fears have prompted the company to consider moving production elsewhere. Unfortunately, Ives says Apple is so reliant on China that the best it could theoretically do is move up to 7% of its iPhone production to India and/or Vietnam over an 18-month stretch. Trump Won't Postpone AgainThere's no question the tariff delays on iPhones is good news for AAPL stock investors. Just don't expect another postponement come December.President Donald Trump has made the trade war with China a centerpiece of his administration. Trump has also branded himself a master negotiator.On Aug. 1, Trump tweeted that he would be implementing new 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese goods not already included in existing U.S. tariffs. In response, China devalued its currency to 10-year lows versus the U.S. dollar.  It also said it would be halting all purchases of U.S. agricultural goods.Yesterday, less than two weeks after Trump's initial 10% tariff tweet, the U.S. Trade Representative tweeted an extensive list of exceptions to the Sept. 1 tariffs. That long list of exceptions looks a lot like backpedaling on the part of Trump.&quot;Tell me why Xi [Jinping] should not continue to wait out The World's Greatest Negotiator, who keeps 'dealing' with himself?&quot; Kynikos Associates founder and managing partner Jim Chanos said on Tuesday.Chanos isn't the only one who sees the delays as weakness on the part of Trump. Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, Trump is not likely to stand for being seen as weak. Come December, AAPL investors shouldn't count on another exemption or postponement. AAPL Stock Needs a Trade DealApple stock got a boost on Tuesday, and there's no question a tariff delay is good news. However, the 4.2% gain was probably a bit much given how little has actually changed. Hence why AAPL gave back most of that gain on Wednesday. Yes, the new iPhone lineup due out in September may now be exempt from tariffs. But Tuesday's news is only bullish assuming a trade deal is reached by the end of the year.&quot;If this tariff situation does not cease after further negotiations or exemption, ultimately Apple will have no choice but to pass this incremental $75 to $100 per smartphone to US consumers during the course of 2020, which would throw a wrench into the upgrade cycle,&quot; Ives said.If not into the 2019 upgrade cycle, it will throw a wrench into the potentially bigger 2020 5G iPhone upgrade cycle.There's also another important event happening in 2020, and China is likely emboldened by Trump's latest concession. Chinese President Xi Jinping knows he doesn't have to outlast Trump indefinitely. If China can endure the fallout from a trade war long enough to see Trump lose the 2020 election, it can simply negotiate a trade deal with the incoming administration.In the meantime, investors should expect China to lean into the trade war as hard as it can stand to try to inflict economic pain on the U.S. ahead of the election.Apple needs a trade deal by Dec. 15, which seems unlikely at this point. In that sense, Tuesday's tariff postponement is simply delaying the inevitable for AAPL stock.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But obstacles do remain. If you want to nibble on Apple stock in today's volatile environment, let's explore three ways to position with stronger risk-adjusted returns.Source: Shutterstock Gravity was no match for Apple stock on Tuesday. Shares of the tech giant and second-largest company in the S&P 500 finished solidly higher by 4.25%. That compares favorably to the broad-based index's own gain of around 1.50%. Apple also easily topped reactions in excess of 2% for market-weighted peers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The bullish price action in Apple stock wasn't without cause either. The Trump Administration announced it was backing away from its imposed Sept. 1 tariff of 10% on certain Chinese goods and pushed the levy threat out to mid-December.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul The removed albatross includes products like iPhones and MacBooks within Apple's electronics fiefdom. Further, with Apple known for its practice of September product releases and the all-important holiday sales season in Q4, Tuesday's revised directive sounds like a big deal for Apple and consumers.But before you start singing &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; and thinking about yuletide cheer, the news isn't picture perfect. For one, there is a volatile POTUS that has made a habit of playing political warfare out of the left field.Additionally and on a company-specific note, Tuesday's 10% levy delay wasn't comprehensive. Newer Apple must-haves such as AirPods, Apple Watch and HomePod, which fall under smaller electronics, didn't make the cut.Lastly and for today's Apple stock investors, while Tuesday's price action was strong and looks promising for more to come, a couple obstacles exist there as well. Apple Stock Weekly Chart A higher high and higher low scored over the past couple weeks in AAPL bodes well for investors as it confirms a bullish trend is underway. And with shares less than 4% above last week's hammer pivot and stochastics looking overall supportive, despite Tuesday's big gain, Apple stock isn't extended either.The immediate risks facing Apple bulls on the price chart are being able to clear a former trendline, and the corrective base's 76% retracement level. Shares will then need to clear a bearish pattern hangman candlestick whose body formed beneath the Fibonacci level. A failure could quickly turn today's emerging uptrend into a more bearish higher low double top formation relative to the October peak.Alternatively, a continuation of the rally in AAPL stock sets up a breakout to new all-time-highs from a fairly healthy and constructive-looking base of nearly one year in duration. Given the circumstances, and for investors that are bullish, I have three trade ideas to construct a better risk-adjusted position. Three Long Strategies in Apple StockThe first strategy simply buys stock today. To keep at arm's length from overall heightened market volatility, while still minimizing downside exposure and technical damage to AAPL's price trend, I'd propose using a $13 stop loss beneath $196. That works out to well-contained exposure of 6% and only exits if the body of last week's hammer candlestick is penetrated.For investors that want to set an absolute limit on their downside risk in Apple stock while retaining upside exposure, two options spreads can help with that.The first of these two strategies is buying an intermediate dated AAPL December $230 / $245 call spread for $3 or less. The positioning of this spread above technical resistance drastically reduces downside risk to about 1.5% of Apple stock while offering a maximum return of 400% and profit of $12 above the higher strike.The second AAPL options spread involves selling the December $200 / $195 put spread and simultaneously buying the December $235 / $245 call spread for even money or better. This packaged combination has characteristics of the two other strategies. At expiration no profit or loss exists in-between $200-$235. Above $235 profits begin to build up to a max gain of $10.

According to data compiled by Bloomberg, nearly 20% of Appleâs 2018 revenue was derived from China, with cell phones a dominant part of its overall business. The companyâs iPhone represents more than 60% of its sales.The 10% tariff had been seen as a major potential headwind. According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, the tariffs would have lowered Appleâs 2020 earnings by 50 to 55 cents a share had they gone into effect. (The consensus is for earnings of $12.76 a share in 2020, per Bloomberg data.)âThe overall China tariff/demand situation represents a $20-$25 overhang on Apple shares and will remain a lingering cloud over the story in the near-term,â Ives wrote in a note published Aug. 13, prior to the news about the tariff delay.Apple was not the only company to spike off the news, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index jumping as much as 2.6% in morning trading. Chipmakers have been among the most impacted by trade-related uncertainty; on Monday, Cowen wrote that a demand recovery for the industry was âlikely capped until a trade resolution is reached.âAmong specific semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments rose 2.4%, Micron Technology spiked 6.2% and Applied Materials was up 2.5%.Best Buy Co Inc., the technology retailer, surged 8.3% following the news of the delay.To contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-13,208.97,202.75,-6.22,-0.029765037999999997,Sell,4,17,318,25,7.861635220125786

At $380 a pair, the new glasses are more than twice as expensive as Snapâs second version. Spectacles 3 are available for preorder, and will be shipped this fall.Snap has not had much success with Spectacles thus far. The company sold more than 200,000 pairs of the original version, which debuted in 2016. But Snap overestimated demand and had to write down almost $40 million in inventory in late 2017. When Snap reported second-quarter results in July, it said revenue from Spectacles was ânot material.âThatâs likely why Snap says Spectacles 3 will be a âlimited editionâ product, with production just a fraction of the original model.So if Snap doesnât make money off Spectacles, and doesnât plan to sell many units, why bother making them at all?Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel is a big believer in augmented reality, and the blending of digital and physical worlds. Snap already has a number of AR software products, like face filters, built into Snapchat. Eventually, the idea is that people will wear cameras and lenses on their faces so that they donât need to use AR through their phones. A Snap spokesman said the latest Spectacles are meant âto draw our community closer to a future in which computing is overlaid on the world, rather than confined to a small screen.âSpiegel isnât the only one interested in AR. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. are working on AR glasses. Microsoft Corp. sells an AR headset called Hololens. Google launched Glass internet-connected eyewear in 2013, but it flopped as a consumer product.If AR takes off, building the hardware will be a competitive business. So it makes sense for Snap to test early versions -- even if users arenât really interested yet.To contact the reporter on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-13,208.97,202.75,-6.22,-0.029765037999999997,Sell,2,7,378,11,2.91005291005291

958,2008,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/faa-bans-recalled-apple-laptops-230926613.html?.tsrc=rss,FAA Bans Recalled MacBook Pros From Flights,2019-08-12,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. airline safety regulators banned select MacBook Pro laptops on flights after Apple Inc. recently said that some units had batteries that posed a fire risk.In a statement, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was âaware of the recalled batteries that are used in some Apple MacBook Pro laptopsâ and stated that it alerted major U.S. airlines about the recall.The watchdog also reminded airlines to follow 2016 safety instructions for goods with recalled batteries, which means that the affected Apple laptops should not be taken on flights as cargo or in carry-on baggage by passengers.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued a warning about these MacBook Pro models earlier this month, telling airlines in the region to follow 2017 rules that require devices with recalled lithium-ion batteries to be switched off and not used during flights.The Apple laptops in question are some 15-inch MacBook Pros sold between September 2015 and February 2017. Apple issued the recall in June, saying it had âdetermined that, in a limited number of older generation 15-inch MacBook Pro units, the battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk.âThis week, four airlines with cargo operations managed by Total Cargo Expertise -- TUI Group Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines, Air Italy, and Air Transat -- implemented a ban, barring the laptops from being brought onto the carriersâ planes as cargo, according to an internal notice obtained by Bloomberg News.âPlease note that the 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro laptop, sold between mid-2015 to February-2017 is prohibited on board any of our mandate carriers,â a TCE operations coordinator wrote to employees.A spokesperson for TUI Group Airlines said airport staff and flight attendants will start making announcements about these MacBook Pros at the gate and before takeoff. Laptops that have replaced batteries wonât be impacted, the spokesperson said. The company also posted a notice on its website banning the recalled computers on board, in both cargo and passenger areas of its planes. Itâs unclear what efforts will, if any, be made at U.S. airports.âCustomer safety is always Appleâs top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to replace affected batteries, free of charge,â Apple said in a June statement. Once new batteries are installed in the laptops, customers are free to fly with the computers.According to a Canadian notice from June, about 432,000 MacBook Pros sold in the U.S. were included in the recall. Roughly 26,000 units sold in Canada were impacted, too, while the number sold in Europe hasnât been disclosed.In a July 10 tweet following an incident involving a MacBook, the FAA said ârecalled batteries do not fly.âThe MacBook Pro isnât the first consumer tech device to be barred from airlines. In 2016, Samsung Electronics Co.âs Note 7 was banned from U.S. flights due to a fire hazard after the handsetâs battery exploded in multiple incidents. Recently recalled laptops like those from HP Inc. may also be banned by the FAAâs rules.While there have been repeated incidents of phones, laptops and other devices overheating and catching fire in passenger compartments of planes, it hasnât ever caused a fire to spread. The flames can be extinguished with water and flight attendants are trained how to address it. There have been at least three accidents, two of them fatal, on cargo airlines since 2006 in which lithium batteries were suspected of helping spread fires. Stricter rules on shipping them have been introduced since then.U.S. aviation regulations prohibit carrying recalled batteries on flights unless theyâve been replaced or stored in special packaging that inhibits fires, according to FAA guidelines on hazardous materials.&#92;--With assistance from Richard Weiss.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Alan Levin in Washington at alevin24@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-12,200.48,208.97,8.49,0.042348364000000006,Buy,18,5,640,41,6.406249999999999

That sent stock markets ripping higher, as bulls cheer the latest move. Let's look at a few stocks that were catching our eye as our top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: S&P 500 (SPY)The action in the S&P 500 is encouraging, with the index holding onto most of its morning gains. Framed on the chart above in black lines is the two-day trading range from the last big rebound on Aug. 8.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Thursday-Friday range was important, as the S&P 500 -- as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) -- was stuck between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.A break of either each had their own implications. In this case, a break of the 100-day put a decline down to the August lows and the 200-day moving average on the table. That was, unless the index was able to reclaim the 100-day, which it conveniently did on Tuesday.Now back over the 100-day, bulls need to push the index back over the 50-day and 20-day moving averages to regain control. If they do, 3,000-plus on the table. The steadily weakening VIX is also a feather in bulls' cap, although a close over 2,942 would help even more. No. 2: Apple (AAPL)Shelving the tariffs until mid-December is a big win for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and it didn't take long for investors to realize it, bidding up Apple more than 4%. Shares briefly penetrated the vital $210 to $212 zone, but failed to hold above it.Bulls now need to push through this zone. If they can, it opens up the post-earnings highs of $220.50. If they fail to, AAPL needs to hold the 50-day on the downside.While Apple did pull back with the rest of the market, it's worth noting that bears weren't really able to crack this one too badly amid the correction. Keep it simple: Above $210 is great, above the 50-day is good and below the 50-day is bad. No. 3: CBS (CBS)The merger between CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Viacom (NYSE:VIA, NYSE:VIAB) is finally official, although the reaction is quite mixed. VIA stock (A shares) are down more than 6%, while VIAB stock (B shares) are up almost 2%. CBS stock is up ~1%.The problem though? CBS wasn't able to reclaim the 200-day and 20-day moving averages, with its intraday rally being sold into. Below the 200-day and prior uptrend support (black line) leaves $47 on the table.A merger is usually good news, but without shares showing much strength, I'm not too encouraged by the action. Below the May lows opens up a can of worms. No. 4: Viacom (B Shares) (VIAB)As for VIAB stock, it too failed to reclaim the 200-day moving average. What are the odds?Anyway, shares are just above range support between $27.50 and $28. So long as that's the case, bulls can justify a long position. However, below this mark opens up a decline down to $25. No. 5: Advance Auto Parts (AAP)Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) hit new 52-week lows in Tuesday's session after reporting its quarterly results. However, shares bounced hard off the lows and closed near flat for the session.That's constructive, although the new lows certainly aren't. The good news is, bulls now have a few upside levels to consider and a level to measure against on the downside.A close below the lows -- currently at $130.09 -- may very well usher in new lows. $130 is a reasonable stop-loss, although still below the 200-week moving average makes AAP a concern.Should it reclaim the 200-week, look for a possible rebound up to prior range support at $150. I suspect this level will act as resistance, but we'll have to wait and see if that's the case, assuming it even gets there in the first place.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

That announcement came as officials from the U.S. and China, the warring factions in the trade spat, agreed to hold talks again in a couple of weeks.&quot;Separately, China's Commerce Ministry said Vice Premier Liu He had spoken by phone with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and they agreed to talk again in two weeks,&quot; according to CNBC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now As recent history shows, trade talks between the U.S. and China can turn on a dime, but at least for today, the news was good and that was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite higher 1.95% while the S&P 500 rose 1.47%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 1.44%.Something that has not been said here very often in recent weeks: in late trading, all 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were in the green. Tech Tops the DowSince stocks rallied due to trade news, it is not surprising that tariff-sensitive technology stocks were among Tuesday's big winners, including Dow components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which added 4.23% and 2.72%, respectively.&quot;Further, as part of USTR's public comment and hearing process, it was determined that the tariff should be delayed to December 15 for certain article,&quot; said the USTR. &quot;Products in this group include, for example, cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing.&quot;That list includes several products that Apple makes and Intel has some exposure to. So while today's pops in those names wasn't surprising, the moves higher were nonetheless embraced by investors.Not to be a downer, but this is an appropriate time to remind readers of just how sensitive technology stocks, including Apple, are to trade tiffs. You've probably experienced that phenomenon first hand this year, and data confirm the sector's export-heavy tendencies. In a note out today, S&P Dow Jones said S&P 500 technology companies got just over 58% of their 2018 sales from ex-U.S. markets, well above the 42.90% rate for the S&P 500 overall. More Dow WinnersAhead of Thursday's earnings reports Walmart (NYSE:WMT) jumped 2.21% today, but this was a tariff sympathy play. Looking at the list of items mentioned by the USTR, Walmart sells all of those things and the largest U.S. retailer hawks plenty of goods made in China.If the positive trade vibes stick, that is meaningful for Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season because the company is a major seller of computers, toys, and video game-related fare. Additionally, many Walmart shoppers are price-sensitive. The idea of the retailer having to pass on tariff costs to consumers is largely viewed as unappealing to investors.Athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) gained 1.67% today. Again, this is a pretty simple scenario to explain: the USTR list mentioned &quot;certain items of footwear and clothing&quot; and Nike certainly makes &quot;certain&quot; clothing and footwear items. Bottom Line: Broad-Based Strength on the DowI'm fond of saying in this space that investors should not get too caught up in the gyrations of a single trading day, no matter how good or bad. However, another bright spot to consider is how broad the strength was.What I'm getting at is, plenty of Dow stocks that are not tariff-sensitive joined Tuesday's party. For example, all of the index's financial services names finished in the green while UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a company with essentially no China exposure, surged 2.50% to finish as the third-best Dow performer behind Apple and Intel. Indeed, that's a positive sign.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

As the trade war intensifies and turmoil in Hong Kong reaches a fever pitch, many are wondering how to trade BABA stock.Source: Shutterstock I would expect a positive earnings report for Alibaba Group. The results could even prompt a positive reaction in BABA stock. However, given the severity of the political strife and the uncertainty that could bring to the company, investors need to remain aware of four factors which could supersede Alibaba stock earnings. Expect an Earnings BeatFor its first quarter, Wall Street forecasts earnings per share of $1.46. The company reported an EPS of $1.16 in the same quarter last year. Analysts also predict revenue of $15.82 billion -- if that estimate holds, it will represent a 35.7% increase from the year-ago quarter when the company brought in $11.66 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now Alibaba stock missed earnings estimates in the same quarter last year. However, its peer JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) surged higher by more than 13% in Tuesday trading following an earnings beat. Although BABA stock may not react the same way, I believe the company will beat earnings. Turmoil in Hong Kong Will Weigh on BABA StockUnfortunately for investors, the only thing even more massive than the revenue and earnings growth is the uncertainty this company faces. The factors that could supersede earnings news mostly lie beyond the company's control.First, the company has begun the process to list Alibaba stock on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. However, this comes at a time when Hong Kong is dealing with massive protests following efforts by the Chinese government to assert more direct authority in the special administrative region. This has led to extreme worries in Hong Kong and has even prompted rumors that the protests will lead to an invasion. We have no way of knowing if that will occur. However, such fears and the intensity of the demonstrations casts obvious doubts over it's initial public offering in Hong Kong. Secondly, any power grab by the Beijing government could serve as a reminder that Alibaba stock is not actually stock in Alibaba Group. Traders have long discounted BABA compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for this reason. However, the political strife surrounding Hong Kong could easily prompt further discounting of the Cayman Islands-based holding company which represents BABA stock. Trade and Jack Ma's Departure Add to UncertaintyA third factor is that Chinese retailers depend on the U.S. even when they do not. This is because the Chinese economy, and many of Alibaba's customers, depend heavily on the American consumer. The trade war has hurt Chinese stocks for more than a year-and-a-half. This includes equities such as BABA stock which conduct a negligible amount of business in the U.S.Fourth, founder Jack Ma will leave his position as chairman of Alibaba in September, completing the full handover of the company to Daniel Zhang. Admittedly, traders will have to wait for years to learn the outcome of this transition. Still, such changes become a concern with conglomerates such as Alibaba. Many remember the decline of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) after Jack Welch left and do not want to see history repeat itself.However, until proven otherwise, I would look at this handover as comparable to Steve Jobs handing the reins to Tim Cook at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Bottom Line on BABA StockFor now, the first-quarter earnings report is a less significant concern for Alibaba stock. Alibaba Group has beaten earnings for the last three quarters. Yes, the company missed estimates during the same quarter last year. Still, I expect BABA stock will exceed expectations in much the same way JD stock beat estimates earlier in the week.However, Alibaba stock faces more daunting challenges, most of which lie outside of the company's control. The company is listing shares in Hong Kong at a time when this former colony of the United Kingdom has become crippled by protests. This could also prompt investors to look at the holding company that represents Alibaba in a different light.Additionally, the political turmoil casts doubts on any business conducted in Hong Kong. Further, many of Alibaba's customers make their living -- in some respect -- with trade from the U.S. Both the trade war and the aforementioned turmoil in Hong Kong bring uncertainty to growth forecasts.Investors could see a bump in Alibaba stock following earnings. Still, with all of the turmoil, I would wait for the dust to settle before considering purchasing BABA stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The safest high-yield bonds reached their weakest level relative to high-grade corporate securities since 2016 by one measure. A fear gauge for the speculative-grade market soared the most on Monday since March.Investors fret that squabbles over trade could do more than just hit corporate profits -- they may push some U.S. companies out of business entirely. Excluding the energy sector, by the middle of next year, around 3.2% of borrowers will have defaulted over the prior 12 months, compared with 2.5% now, UBS strategists forecast this week. That change is largely because of intensifying trade wars.âThe longer this goes on, the more pain is going to be felt on both sides and junk-bond prices could fall to reflect the potential for higher default rates,â said Brian Kennedy, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co., which managed about $280 billion at the end of June.Not every junk bond is getting hit, and some companies are still finding solid demand for their securities. Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings is expected to sell a $1.26 billion debt offering this week with yields toward the bottom end of original expectations. There is almost $15 trillion of negative yielding debt globally, forcing money managers to seek higher returns in the U.S.But fears about tariffs and currency moves have been enough to counter the marketâs exuberance about Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, which can reduce borrowing costs for companies. Average junk-bond yields have risen more than 0.6 percentage point since June 20 to around 6.3%, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data through August 7. Investors yanked $4.07 billion from junk-bond funds in the week ended Wednesday, the most since October.Read more in this weekâs Credit Brief: Trade War Casualties; Shrinking BB MarketThat jump came even as the Fed last week lowered rates for the first time in a decade, which brought benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest levels since 2016. High-yield market conditions were bad enough to spur US Farathane LLC, which supplies plastic parts to the auto industry, to pull a high-yield bond offering this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Sirius Minerals Plc, a mining company, suspended a bond sale as well.The story is different for investment-grade company bonds, where yields fell below 3% for the first time since 2016. Risk premiums on the securities, the extra yield above Treasuries that investors get for holding the bonds, had widened from the end of July through Wednesday, but were still below levels seen in early June.Escalating WarRisk premiums, or spreads, are high for junk bonds relative to investment-grade securities. One way to compare those two figures is to look at spreads for the safest high yield bonds, those rated in the BB tier, and the lowest quality high-grade bonds, rated in the BBB tier. Over the preceding two weeks, the difference in risk premiums widened by 0.43 percentage point to 2.31 percentage points, the biggest gap since the U.S. presidential elections in November 2016, according to strategists at JPMorgan on Wednesday. They adjusted their figures for duration.U.S. President Donald Trump last week abruptly ramped up his trade war with China, announcing a 10% tariff on another $300 billion of imports from the nation. Beijing responded by letting its currency weaken, a move that makes the nationâs goods cheaper for Americans, and by asking state-owned enterprises to suspend purchases of U.S. agricultural products. On Thursday, the Peopleâs Bank of China was seen as trying to stabilize the currency, and U.S. markets broadly rallied.âIncremental CostâTrumpâs latest round of tariffs could hurt the U.S. tech sector, because it includes a broader range of tech products than prior duties, including Apple iPhones and Dell servers, according to a report from S&P Global Ratings. Economists at UBS forecast the levies could reduce U.S. gross domestic product by 0.25 percentage point, and lower Chinaâs as well. Other areas that are exposed include retail and energy and mining, UBS said.âThereâs an incremental cost to every company that gets caught in the cross-hairs,â said Lale Topcuoglu, senior fund manager and head of credit at J O Hambro Capital Management.Companies exposed to trade wars are already cutting their expectations for future earnings. For example, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc., which makes paper, lumber, and other wood-based products, said this week it was cutting its full-year forecasts for a measure of results.The lowest rated bonds, those graded in the CCC tier, have been hit hardest. Theyâve gained just 5.1% this year through Wednesday, compared with the overall high-yield marketâs 9.4%, and have fallen the most of any junk ratings group since the start of last week.With risks rising and bond yields broadly falling, performance among different parts of the high-yield market is varying more, said Andrew Feltus, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, which managed about $84 billion as of June 30. Picking the right securities is even more important than it usually is.âWe havenât panicked yet, but weâve been a lot more sensitive to where valuations are,â Feltus said.To contact the reporters on this story: Katrina Lewis in New York at klewis128@bloomberg.net;Caleb Mutua in New York at dmutua@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Dan WilchinsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-09,200.99,200.48,-0.51,-0.00253744,Don't move,2,50,913,54,5.914567360350493
1000,2058,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/saudi-aramco-answer-three-tough-093005070.html?.tsrc=rss,Saudi Aramco Has to Answer Three Tough Questions,2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Saudi Aramco, the worldâs largest oil company, will hold a public investor-relations call on Monday, even though the company is private and has only one shareholder. Many analysts expect that, for the first time, the Saudi Arabian behemoth will speak openly about its finances, including its earnings from the first half of 2019. But the call is also being seen as a potential staging for a long-delayed initial public offering that has recently received renewed vocal support from the royal family. Aramco is restarting the IPO process, and is in talks with banks over it, although shares of the company may not hit markets until 2021.There is no immediate need for equities investors to be interested in an Aramco investor-relations call, because the companyâs shares are not available for purchase. If an IPO happens, it will be preceded by a roadshow and other opportunities for potential investors to learn more about the firm. At this point, an open call serves more to satisfy curiosity and perhaps help sell-side analysts begin to familiarize themselves with the giant firm that up until now no one had a reason to follow.Aramco already shared a great deal of financial information in a prospectus it published before a sale of about $12 billion in bonds in April. The prospectus revealed information about the company that had long been kept secret: For example, that Aramco saw $111 billion in net profit in 2018 â more than twice as much as Apple Inc âÂ and we were given some details about the companyâs financial relationship with the absolute monarchy of Saudi Arabia.Still, there is much more that investors need to know about Aramco before considering a stake in the company, because it is truly unique. Aramcoâs operations are skewed towardÂ upstream, meaning the exploration and production of crude oil, in contrast to the big international oil companies, which have shifted their focus toward refining and selling finished products. Aramcoâs profits are incomparably higher than any other public of private firm; and its dependence on the good graces of an autocratic government is absolute. This last trait is one that the companyâs investor relations team will need to explore openly to satisfy investors if and when an IPO does happen.Even with the initial offering months or years away, there are big questions that Aramco should start answering for potential investors now. Here are three that analysts need answered on Monday:1) Who has the ultimate decision-making power for Aramco? According to company, the decision to go public, including when and where that happens, is up to âthe shareholder.â The company spokespeople now say the shareholder is the government, but traditionally this is the term that Aramco employees used to describe the king. The current leadership, King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are not professionals in finance or energy, nor have they ever worked in business of any type in any significant way. Potential investors will want to know who is making decisions at the company âÂ chief executive officer Amin Nasser and the board of directors, or the king and his son?Until 2015, the oil professionals at Aramco exercised almost unfettered control over spending, investment and strategic vision. Under their management, Aramco grew into the multibillion-dollar, integrated powerhouse it is today. Recently, however, the Saudi royal family has interfered, notably pushing the company to purchase the petroleum-chemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp from the Saudi Public Investment Fund, and announcing IPO plans with an astronomical $2 trillion expected valuation back in 2016. The crown prince now serves as chairman of the Supreme Aramco Council, which has oversight even above the board of directors, and which one executive told me serves as the âshareholder representative.â2) On the occasion of an Aramco IPO, what limitations would be placed on the authority the Saudi monarchy has over the company? In 2018, Aramco issued a corporate charter, in Arabic only, that essentially served as articles of incorporation and bylaws. The charter included several clauses to maintain the voting power of âthe shareholderâ if outsiders gained ownership of some shares. This protects the king and the government, but investors will want assurances that they and their interests are protected from the whims of a king or a prince whose interests may not align with those of the company.3) When will Aramco cease providing expensive and resource-consuming services to the kingdom and royal family that are beyond its purview as an oil company, as stated in its January 2018 charter?Since its early days as an American firm in the 1930s, Aramco has provided goods and services free of charge for the kingdom and royals. In the 1950s, Aramco wired the palace of the local governor, transported a gift elephant across the desert, and painted its planes with the Saudi flag before flying the king around Arabia. In recent years, Aramco provided cheap fuel for every aspect of the Saudi economy and society. Aramco even built the countryâs premier soccer stadium.According to the bond prospectus, Aramco still operates a research institute in Riyadh and a university north of Jeddah on behalf of the kingdom.

1001,2059,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-trying-trade-war-proof-210000492.html?.tsrc=rss,How Huawei Is Trying to Trade War-Proof Its Software,2019-08-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. on Friday offered the first glimpse of an in-house software that may someday replace Googleâs Android, an important step toward reducing its reliance on American technology.âHarmonyOS,â previously code-named âHongmeng,â is a long-gestating operating system that could soon find its way into smart TVs and lower-end phones. The OS embodies Huaweiâs shift toward self-reliance as American sanctions cut it off from vital technology, and escalating U.S.-Chinese tariffs jeopardize a carefully orchestrated global supply chain. Huaweiâs efforts actually mirror Apple Inc.âs: to develop vertically-integrated supply and production lines that help reduce exposure to inclement market forces, unreliable suppliers and unpredictable events like international trade disputes.The newly hostile environment is putting to the test not just Appleâs âDesigned in California, Assembled in Chinaâ slogan, but the overall preparedness of two smartphone-making giants as the decades-old made-in-China model fractures. Hereâs a look at how dependent Apple and Huawei are on external suppliers.OS: Appleâs strength has always been the integration of software with hardware, and it has absolute control over iOS. Huawei is trying to do the same with HarmonyOS, but it has everything left to prove, starting today. For the foreseeable future, Huawei remains dependent on Android for its mainstream smartphones, especially outside China. Advantage: Apple.Software ecosystem: The enormous fortress of iTunes, the App Store and a dedicated following of enthusiastic app developers is a huge and profitable edge for Appleâs mobile business. Huawei will need developers to build valuable apps for its ecosystem, which is another major question mark. Advantage: Apple.Processors: Both design their own processors but neither controls their actual production. Instead, they rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to put them together and on SoftBank Group Corp.âs Arm for the licenses they need to design semiconductors. Advantage: Neither.Memory and storage: SK Hynix Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc. anchor the two smartphone makersâ storage needs. The Korean duo have a significant lead on RAM modules. Neither Apple nor Huawei has the capability to produce their own storage chips, though Huawei recently launched the Nano Memory Card. Advantage: Neither.Display: Samsung is the biggest supplier of the organic light-emitting diode displays that Apple uses for its iPhone X and XS top-tier devices. Others such as Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co. provide liquid-crystal display panels for the likes of the iPhone XR and earlier models. While Huawei is in much the same boat, itâs increasingly relying on home-team vendor BOE Technology Group Co. for its OLED panels, which are starting to win customers beyond China. In short, neither is capable of doing the manufacturing itself. Advantage: Neither.Modems: Essential to mobile connectivity, modems are only going to become more important with the transition to next-generation 5G technology. Apple recently agreed to buy Intelâs modem division, a step toward designing its own 5G chips. But Huawei is already among the leaders on this front, having announced the Balong 5G01 modem in February. As with processors, neither has its own silicon facilities so theyâll again be reliant on specialist foundries. Advantage: Huawei.Assembly: Apple and Huawei are heavily reliant on assemblers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn. Both also tap other Taiwanese contract manufacturers -- such as Pegatron Corp., Compal Electronics Inc. and Quanta Computer Inc. -- to varying degrees, while Huawei also relies on Flex Ltd. But unlike Apple, which decided years to outsource much of its global production in China, Huawei operates a few highly automated lines to make top-tier P series phones. Advantage: Huawei.Others: Apple and Huawei rely on a plethora of companies elsewhere in their smartphone production. U.S. companies Skyworks and Qorvo provide radio-frequency modules to facilitate 3G and LTE communications. Dutch semiconductor company NXP is the go-to supplier of NFC parts required for contactless payments. Sony Corp. is the undisputed leader in camera sensors and modules. And Apple-funded Corning Inc. supplies toughened glass. Advantage: Neither.Apple and Huawei appear to be the brains orchestrating a huge, international body of engineering muscle. They design their own software, processors, modems and phones, but ultimately have to hand those plans off to a legion of transnational suppliers and manufacturers.(Updates with OSâs unveiling from first paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Vlad Savov in Tokyo at vsavov5@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-09,200.99,200.48,-0.51,-0.00253744,Don't move,12,21,734,45,6.130790190735695

Sign up here.Â Huawei Technologies Co. took the wraps off its âHarmonyOSâ operating system Friday, offering the first glimpses of in-house software that may someday replace Googleâs Android and reduce its reliance on American technology.To begin with, the open-source software will skip smartphones and instead find its way into everything from cars and watches to personal computers by 2020, Richard Yu, chief executive of the consumer business said during a launch event. Earbuds and virtual reality goggles will follow. Huawei is considering running the OS on its upcoming flagship Mate 30, he told reporters.âBecause we support Googleâs Android ecosystem, we will prioritize Android for smartphones. If we canât use Android, we can install HarmonyOS quickly,â Yu said at Huaweiâs developers conference in Dongguan. âWe had a great chance to become the worldâs biggest vendor by shipment -- if not for the trade war.âHarmonyOS, previously code-named âHongmengâ or âArk,â is an important part of Huaweiâs effort to develop alternatives in response to sanctions on American technology it needs to make its gear. Underscoring the unpredictability of supply, Bloomberg News reported the White House is delaying a decision about licenses for U.S. companies to resume selling to Huawei.Chinaâs largest technology company has found itself at the center of sensitive trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, with the latter accusing its geopolitical rival of stealing technology and posing a risk to U.S. national security. Irrespective of how the talks play out, Trump administrative curbs have all but smothered Huaweiâs goal of overtaking Samsung Electronics Co. to become the worldâs largest maker of smartphones.While Huaweiâs operating system may serve it well in its domestic market, any plans to dethrone Googleâs Android globally will be misplaced, according to Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.âHuawei with deep pockets and scale in China can pull this off in the domestic market, but to reach Google Android level service integration and app quality outside China is going to be less trivial and a mammoth task,â he said.Huawei seems confident it can do it. âOur HarmonyOS is more powerful and secure than Android, and it has greater distributed capability and is future-facing,â Yu said. âCan HarmonyOS be installed on smartphones? Of course.âFor HarmonyOS to work, Huawei will need developers to build apps for its ecosystem -- a major question mark around its fledgling software. âIt took Android a decade to reach here with deep integration of Google Mobile Services, and it now has a well curated and relatively secure App Store with millions of apps, advanced AI capabilities,â Shah added.Last year, Huawei spent at least 500 million yuan ($70 million) to lure developers to work on its homegrown OS, and the company may invest more this year, said Yu. âThe biggest attraction is our profit-sharing scheme. We may only keep 10% of the app profits and leave the rest to developers,â he said.The efficacy of HarmonyOS is something Huawei still has to prove. Yu went into back-end technical details but refrained from describing consumer-facing features, suggesting it may not yet be ready for prime-time.To help with app migration, HarmonyOS will be built on the Linux and Huaweiâs own LiteOS kernels for now, Yu said, which will change in future generations of the OS.Two months into a Trump administration ban that cut off Huawei from American suppliers, Huawei is starting to feel the pinch. It warned of a tougher performance in the second half of 2019 and has been internally preparing for a drop in overseas smartphone shipments of a staggering 60 million units. Yu said Friday that sanctions imposed in May had already reduced smartphone shipments by more than 10 million units in the second quarter.Huawei is delaying the release of its first foldable smartphone Mate X because of âproduction volume issuesâ. Yu warned buyers may have to wait until November for the long-awaited product. The postponement is a major blow for the Chinese company, which is battling Samsung and Apple in the global smartphone market.Huawei has looked to its home turf to offset international headwinds. The company has assigned as many as 10,000 engineers, working across three shifts a day, to develop alternatives to American software and components. Huawei already designs its own HiSilicon Kirin processors, though it retains a reliance on U.S. firms such as Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Inc. for additional wireless chips.And itâs focusing on domestic sales: the company commanded 37% of the Chinese smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC, giving it roughly the same share as the second and third largest vendors combined. Strong home-market sales boosted Huaweiâs shipments by 24% to 118 million units in the first half, the company said earlier.(Updates with comments from analyst in the seventh paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Simran Jagdev.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-08,203.43,200.99,-2.44,-0.011994298,Don't move,3,26,840,32,3.8095238095238098

(NYSE:UBER) was awful. Not only that, Uber stock took a beating in the afterhours session upon the disclosure, losing more than 6%.Source: Shutterstock Let's take a look at the numbers. Prior to the second-quarter report, analysts forecasted that Uber Technologies Inc would deliver an earnings-per-share loss of $3.19. Instead, the company produced a devastating EPS loss of $4.77. Clearly, that was well off most analysts' expectations. In the regular-hours session prior to the print, the Uber stock price had gained more than 8%.But it wasn't just the red ink that irked investors. Instead, it was the reason for the profitability miss. Primarily, Uber Technologies made several large stock-based transactions following its much-hyped initial public offering. For example, the ride-sharing firm paid $3.9 billion in Uber stock for compensations and expenses in Q2. Additionally, management paid $298 million to drivers using a combination of equity and cash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Of course, the company must keep their drivers happy; otherwise, this whole ride-sharing experiment falls apart very quickly. However, we must appreciate the stakeholders' mindset. They want to see earnings reinvested back into the company for sales growth and expansion. Instead, management looks operationally undisciplined, which explains the fallout in the Uber stock price.Unfortunately, the Q2 report doesn't do me any favors either. A few months back and just prior to the Uber IPO, I emphasized my belief that this company, along with rival Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) represented transformative investments. Now, my support for Uber stock looks silly. Wall Street's Looking at Uber Stock IncorrectlyAs I mentioned above, I fully realize that the print is ugly. I'm not going to attempt linguistical jiu-jitsu to convince you otherwise. But what I will say is this: most of Wall Street is using the wrong framework when analyzing the Uber stock price.For a better approach, investors should adopt the same mentality with marijuana stocks. The ride-sharing economy has many components similar to the green plant. Both are paradigm-shifting investments in that they have sparked an unprecedented new market. Both suffer legal and administration concerns that eventually will find some solution. And finally, these two markets have tremendous upside potential but will require patience in the here and now.Let me stress the word patience again. Recall that e-commerce powerhouse Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wasn't initially a Wall Street darling. In fact, during its early years following its IPO, Amazon consistently reported bad losses.Further, imagine what critics said during that period. E-commerce? Random people selling goods to perfect strangers? That would never work in a million years!Except that it did work, and it only took a couple of years. Although we have hindsight's perfect vision, you didn't have to be a futurist to see the writing on the wall. Even back in the 1990s, it was clear through companies like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) that the internet would transform commerce.And I'm telling you that Uber Technologies Inc is the Amazon of the 1990s, or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) circa the 1980s. You'll probably have to suffer through some quirks and ugly earnings reports. But the on-demand sharing economy will disrupt and replace traditional services. Therefore, the panic toward the Uber stock price is unnecessary.But since human nature is what it is, use this as a buying opportunity in Uber stock. Q2 Produced Outstanding NumbersAnother reason why I'm very confident about the longer-term trajectory of the Uber stock price is the fundamental mismatch. More specifically, shares went down sharply when the Q2 report produced some tremendously positive results.Let the bears focus on the earnings print all they want. I'm going to look at an incredibly viable component of the company's business, Uber Eats. For those that don't know, this is Uber's food-delivery service. It is quick, convenient, and reasonably priced (relatively speaking). Uber Eats was the first time outside of ordering pizza that I used a food-delivery service. Certainly, it won't be the last.The beauty here is that my anecdotal story has quantifiable validity. According to the Q2 report, Uber Eats' user base jumped 140% from the year-ago quarter. In addition, 40% of Uber Eats customers had never used the Uber platform before.I want you to think about that. As an investment, Uber taps into two relevant revenue channels: ride sharing and on-demand food deliveries. Furthermore, each sub-segment evangelizes the benefits of the other. Frankly, I can't think of another mass-scale service-based company that levers this attribute.In closing then, maybe the markets should panic and drive the Uber stock price lower. That just gives me an opportunity to pick some up on the cheap.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

So that number could be far higher than 84%.A.I. is a trend we're following closely (and cashing in on) at Growth Investor. And artificial intelligence stocks are all around us already. Here are a few more examples that should sound familiar:  * If you have an Android, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) device, there's Google Assistant, Cortana and Alexa, respectively.  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) uses A.I. to recommend movies and TV shows for you.  * When you look up the online real-estate listings on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), it gives you a price &quot;Zestimate&quot; that's based on A.I. Then, Zillow also uses A.I. to recommend similar houses.  * TurboTax, Quickbooks and Mint - which all come from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) - use A.I., too. That's how QuickBooks Assistant can track your business expenses automatically. And they're even working on a TurboTax app that can do your taxes automatically, too!  * If you've ordered food from Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN), and even Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN), your order may have been taken by A.I. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) just rolled out A.I. ordering, tooâ¦and the list goes on.In this new world of A.I. everywhere, data becomes a hot commodity. Artificial Intelligence Stocks: &quot;Data is the New Oil&quot;As scientists find even more applications for artificial intelligence - from hospitals to retail to self-driving cars - it's incredible to imagine how much data will be involved.To create A.I. programs in the first place, tech companies must collect vast amounts of data on human decisions. Data is what powers every A.I. system. As one A.I. researcher from the University of South Florida puts it, &quot;data is the new oil.&quot;So, as investors, if we want to buy the right artificial intelligence stocks to ride this trend, all we have to do is look back at the oil boom of the 2000s.Back in 2003, if investors believed that crude oil was set for a big price rise, they had a handful of different vehicles to choose from. They could buy speculative futures contractsâ¦ they could buy a small oil company exploring for oil in some remote jungleâ¦ or they could have bought shares in Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB).Core did no drilling or exploration of its own. It provided technology to the companies who did. So, rather than take on the risk of owning shares in a company looking for oil in just a handful of places, a Core Laboratories investor could sleep soundly. They knew the company was collecting a steady stream of money from a huge number of oil companies.As oil prices climbed from $30 per barrel in 2003 to $100 per barrel in 2008, Core's customers had more money to spend on exploration. Core's revenues surgedâ¦ and CLB stock went from $5 per share to $60 per shareâ¦ a gain in market value of 1,100%.Now, picture an industry like Big Oil as a huge skyscraper with lots of offices. By buying stock in an individual oil company, it's like having a key to one of those offices. By buying Core Laboratories, it's like having a &quot;Master Key&quot; to all of them. The A.I. &quot;Master Key&quot;Core Laboratories was the Master Key to the 2000s oil boom. And here, the Master Key is the company that makes the &quot;brain&quot; that all A.I. software needs to function, spot patterns, and interpret data.It's known as the &quot;Volta Chip&quot; - and it's what makes the A.I. revolution possible.Some of the biggest players in elite investing circles have large stakes in the A.I. Master Key:  * Ron Baron, billionaire money manager with one of the biggest estates in the Hamptons.  * Ken Fisher, author of The Ten Roads to Riches and other bestsellers, who's made the Forbes 400 Richest Americans list.  * Mario Gabelli, namesake of the Gabelli Funds, with a salary of $85 million for one year - Wall Street's highest paid CEO.None of them, however, are programmersâ¦or any kind of tech guru. You don't need to be an A.I. expert to take part. I'll tell you everything you need to know, as well as my buy recommendation, in my special report for Growth Investor, The A.I. Master Key. The stock is still under my buy limit price - so you'll want to sign up now; that way, you can get in while you can still do so cheaply.Click here for a free briefing on this groundbreaking innovation.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

But $167.7 million of that was &quot;platform revenue,&quot; ads and other services delivered to existing Roku owners. The margins on that business are 65%, against just 5% from selling players. Roku is becoming a sustainable business and could become a wildly profitable one.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRoku's new title is the one it has sought since its founding: gateway to the streaming world. ROKU Out-Amazoning AmazonThe business model for Roku is similar to that of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire Stick. Offer something for nothing, then offer everything else.In the case of Amazon, this is its Prime Video service, which comes with its $10-per-month free shipping plan. In the case of Roku it's an ad-based, free streaming service.  * 10 Internet Stocks Getting Hammered More important, consumers now trust Roku more than Amazon. It now has 43% of the connected TV market against just 18% for Amazon. TVs, in turn, represent 55% of streaming hours. What it means is that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), with its Chromecast, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with its Apple TV, are now marginal players.Tech markets are notoriously sticky. It's not so much getting there first that matters but getting there first with the most. Once a niche scales, market leadership can be impossible to dislodge. That's why AT&T (NYSE:T) is no longer in the cloud, and why International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is no longer in PCs.The implications of this are staggering, which is why Roku's market cap of $13.6 billion represents almost 14 times this year's expected revenue. It's also why Variety covered the company's earnings. Roku's ChoiceRoku is choosing to focus on maintaining credibility with its audience, limiting ads on its TV channel. It lacks the cash to create a competitor to Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.Despite owning a service, Roku is portraying itself as neutral in the coming streaming wars. Roku says it will offer all services, advertise them, and just take a cut of the initial sale. It's also calling itself a privacy advocate, a trustworthy place for consumers to leave their streaming data.How long it can hold itself above the market in this way is an open question. Any of the major players in either technology or entertainment --  AT&T, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Apple, Alphabet or even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- could force its sale with the equivalent of seat-cushion money.That's why the most interesting Roku news of this week may be its alliance with Walmart (NYSE:WMT). New Roku products will be introduced in Walmart stores under a Walmart brand. Given Walmart's ambitions against Amazon, that's yet-another player in the mix once the bidding for Roku gets serious. The Bottom Line on Roku StockThe Roku stock price is beyond any concept of fundamental value.  * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now But given its prospects, it is not out of line. Roku has created a gigantic market share in a scaled market, a market that looks set to dominate TV in the next decade.Roku has a target on its back, but it's not the one you think. Leads like this are only lost when a company spends outrageous amounts of money or truly builds a better mousetrap. Streaming technology is a commodity.The target Roku has on its back is from every other streaming player eyeing its success and preparing to bid for it. That's why the stock's price is now so outrageous. Roku doesn't know it, but it's for sale.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Advertisers and ad-tech companies have also met with the officials, and more meetings are on the calendar, one of the people said.The focus on advertising and search operations signals where the department could be taking its inquiry, which is in its early stages and could drag on for months. The range of companies meeting with the antitrust officials goes beyond those that have previously voiced complaints, which include Oracle Corp., News Corp. and Yelp Inc., the person said.Bloomberg reported in June that the Justice Department was preparing to investigate Google, but this is the first indication of the status and scope of the review.The antitrust division, led by Makan Delrahim, is pouring resources into the inquiry, drawing in lawyers from other sections of the agency to study the issues, one of the people said. While the division is exploring the digital advertising and search markets in the reviewâs initial stages, it will continue to narrow down the ultimate focus, one of the people said.Google controls much of the technology that news publishers and marketers use to serve ads across the internet and nets most of its revenue from ads. The company reported $116.3 billion in advertising revenue last year, which represented 85% of overall sales. It doesnât break out its revenue by channels. Publishers and rivals have complained that Googleâs dominance hinders competition in that market. Earlier this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for violating competition law with its online practices.Google said its innovations have reduced prices and expanded choice for consumers and merchants, pointing to its testimony before a House antitrust panel in July. âWe have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,â Google lawyer Adam Cohen said in prepared comments for the hearing. âWe have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.âThe Justice Department declined to comment. The people described the investigation under condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the inquiry.Attorney General William Barr has elevated a lawyer from the antitrust division to be his point person on the review, signaling his hands-on interest in the issue. Lauren Willard has been appointed to serve as his counselor and report to him on developments in the inquiry, according to a department official.The Justice Department last month announced its broad review of whether technology giants are hurting competition following mounting criticism across Washington that the companies have become too big and too powerful. The department hasnât specified which firms it would scrutinize.Bloomberg reported in June that U.S. antitrust agencies carved up oversight of four tech giants, with the department taking Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Apple Inc., and the Federal Trade Commission claiming Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Read More: Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech AssaultThe investigation is a sign of the escalating pressure on tech giants, from Capitol Hill to President Donald Trump, who accuses the companies of silencing conservative views.The giants of the industry are under fire over massive collection of user data, failing to police content on their platforms, and claims that they are harming competition and reducing choices for consumers.&#92;--With assistance from Chris Strohm, Naomi Nix, Mark Bergen and Ben Brody.To contact the reporters on this story: Sara Forden in Washington at sforden@bloomberg.net;David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark NiquetteFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-07,199.04,203.43,4.39,0.022055868,Buy,1,14,644,16,2.484472049689441

Apple has long positioned the security of its systems as a core tenet of its products.The special phones will disable some security features and enable deeper access for researchers, Krstic told Bloomberg News after the announcement. The program is scheduled to launch next year.Apple also said it is expanding its âbug bountyâ program to the Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and iPad operating systems. The program will pay security researchers who find and report security flaws in the software. Apple opened a similar program for iOS, its operating system for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, and cloud storage, three years ago.The company has been paying those who find flaws as much as $200,000, but despite that dollar amount, the company has been criticized for paying too little to stop bugs that could impact its consumer security. The company said it will offer a 50% payout bonus if a flaw is found in a beta version before it ships to consumers.Itâs also expanding the bounty program to more security researchers in the fall, Apple said. In addition, the company is adding a new $1 million bug bounty tier for more advanced security flaws and a $500,000 tier for reporting flaws giving access to user data.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;William Turton in New York at wturton1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Martin at amartin146@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-07,199.04,203.43,4.39,0.022055868,Buy,8,1,310,17,5.483870967741936

In fact, very rarely do I use such terminology, because it can come across as disingenuous. But when it comes to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) stock, that's exactly the scenario we may have.Source: Shutterstock This company remains a powerhouse when it comes to online domination -- perhaps too much so for its own good. Alphabet stock is facing antitrust probes from the U.S. government, as are many of its FAANG brethren. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all likely on the list. Alphabet has also caught the eye of President Donald Trump.While that could spell trouble down the road, remember that Alphabet dominates online search (Google) and online video (YouTube), while its collection of assets is hard to match.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Business Is Good for GOOGL StockHere's the thing about Alphabet stock: the company just reported a great earnings result. Earnings of $14.21 per share erupted past estimates by $2.75 per share. Revenue of $39.94 billion grew more than 19% year-over-year and topped estimates by more than $730 million.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now Yeah, it was a good quarter.Operating margin of 24% came in well ahead of analysts' expectations for 22.6% and management approved a $25 billion buyback. Its &quot;Other&quot; category revenue easily topped estimates, with sales of $6.18 billion versus a $5.63 billion estimate. The beat was led by a strong showing from its cloud business. Management hopes to triple its cloud sales force in the coming years, showing no signs of slowing down.Remember, the cloud is what's helping drive Amazon higher. Additionally, it elevated Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to a trillion-dollar valuation. YouTube is the Alphabet's second-fastest revenue grower, accelerating the top line.Better-than-expected sales growth combined with lower-than-expected spending and consensus-beating margins helped drive the substantial earnings beat. Investors finally saw something to like in GOOGL stock, with shares rallying 10% in response to the report.Since the selloff took hold though, shares have given up almost all of those gains. The Balance Sheet Is RobustWhat's one thing that investors consistently overlook in my view? Alphabet's balance sheet. This thing is a mammoth, as the company recently took the cash crown from Apple.Alphabet boasts cash and short-term equivalents of $121 billion, up 18.4% year-over-year. Perhaps even more impressive, that's up 6.7% from the prior quarter just three months ago. Cash makes up approximately 15% of the total market capitalization for Alphabet stock.Total current assets are up 18.75% year-over-year. Moreover, total assets are up 21.5% and weigh in at an astounding $257.1 billion. That easily out-muscles total liabilities of just $64.9 billion. GOOGL stock may get hammered in a recession thanks to it being in tech, but almost no company seems as safe as Alphabet. Trading Alphabet StockI am a long-time shareholder of Alphabet stock, but I do trade around some of my position. I was lucky enough to bail on GOOGL stock right before its first-quarter earnings in April. Shares were up more than 30% in four months and I felt it was too much, too fast. Unfortunately for me, I did not get a fill in Alphabet down at $1,020 in June.Anyone who has followed my work on InvestorPlace knows I love nibbling on Alphabet when the GOOGL stock price drops into the $1,000 to $1,020 range. But stingy investors have been given another gift: A post-earnings pullback.  Click to Enlarge Despite a strong rally, six straight declines since have eliminated almost all of the recent gains. On Monday, the GOOGL stock price knifed through the 20-day moving average and 38.2% retracement like they weren't even there. That's the same day Loop Capital analysts bumped their price target by $100 up to $1,350 on the name.Active investors can buy Alphabet stock should it solidly reclaim the $1,170 mark and look for a move higher from there. But this is a tough environment right now and investors should keep that in mind.Should we get a deeper pullback, GOOGL will be attractive to long-term holders. Between the 50-day and 200-day moving average confluence at $1,124 and the 50% retracement near $1,140 may be a good place to start accumulating. Below and the 61.8% retracement comes into play near $1,100.While painful in the short-term, we'd be lucky to get another opportunity below $1,040.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

1066,2127,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-vision-fund-delivering-061239072.html?.tsrc=rss,SoftBankâs Profit Beat Shows Its Vision Fund Is Delivering,2019-08-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son canât wait to wash his hands of Sprint Corp.SoftBank Group Corp. will stop consolidating the U.S. carrier in its results starting next earnings report, anticipating a successful merger with T-Mobile USA Inc. despite questions over the dealâs eventual closing. That accounting change will slash SoftBankâs debt load and help it shed its image as a staid telecoms company, the Japanese billionaire said Wednesday.Son is eager to put the Sprint chapter behind him. The wireless carrierâs roughly $47 billion debt pile has weighed on its Japanese ownerâs valuation ever since the latter agreed to pay $21.6 billion for a majority stake in 2012. Son in turn has repeatedly railed at investors for misjudging his companyâs true value. Now, the entrepreneur can better plug SoftBank as an technology investment powerhouse, allowing him to focus his energies on the $100 billion Vision Fund and its $108 billion successor.âFor years, investors have focused on the immediate struggles at Sprint, overlooking the longer-term potential of Sonâs technology investments,â said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group.The accounting change will reduce the groupâs overall interest-bearing debt load by about 29%. But because Sprintâs borrowings are non-recourse to the parent, meaning the Japanese company will not owe anything to its U.S. unitâs creditors, the removal of the debt from the balance sheet is largely symbolic and may not affect SoftBankâs credit rating.Son has previously pointed out that the Sprint excision will have a significant impact on SoftBankâs annual interest expenses â as much as halving them â which amounts to an even greater reduction than in the overall debt because Sprint pays higher interest on its borrowings.âThere is still a lingering image of SoftBank as a debt-laden telecommunications company,â Son said at the briefing. âThatâs quite different from the truth.âOn Wednesday, SoftBank reported first-quarter profit that beat the highest analyst estimate thanks to valuation gains from Vision Fund investments such as Slack Technologies Inc., which went public in June, hotel chain OYO Rooms and food-delivery app DoorDash Inc. The gains were offset by a 195.3 billion yen decline in the fair value of holdings including Uber Technologies Inc. Operating income in the three months ended June slipped 3.7% to 688.8 billion yen ($6.5 billion), but trumped the 345.3 billion yen average analyst estimate. SoftBank also said the Vision Fund held 81 investments worth about $66.3 billion.The Sprint accounting change signals Sonâs confidence in sealing the deal. While the Justice Department approved the acquisition last month, the transaction has been held up by an antitrust lawsuit by more than a dozen states including California and New York. Texas was the latest to join the fight last week. The deal already has the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has expressed support.âThere hasnât been a case in history where you had those three approvals and the deal didnât get done,ââ Son said.Sprint has been profitable for only one of the past five years. It accounted for 38% of SoftBankâs revenue in the three months ended June, slightly less than the companyâs domestic telecom operations.Son originally considered buying T-Mobile in 2014 before abandoning the effort when officials at the FCC and Justice Department signaled they were against a theoretical merger with Sprint. Another attempt at a merger fizzled out in late 2017 amid disagreement over control. SoftBank finally agreed to sell Sprint to T-Mobile in 2018, getting about a 27.4% stake in the resulting entity in return.The billionaire acknowledged that his Sprint purchase has been largely seen as a failure, but said that SoftBank generated a 21% rate of return on the deal. All but 400 billion of the 2.1 trillion yen acquisition came from borrowing, he said. That smaller proportion of shareholder value has tripled to 1.3 trillion yen, ânot bad at all as an investment.ââFrom a sentiment perspective, Sprint got in the way of a lot of investors, who thought of it as a bad deal,â said Chris Lane, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. âThis at least cleans up a mess. Itâs a good save and allows them to move on.âLast month, Son announced that heâs setting up a second Vision Fund. SoftBank is committing $38 billion in capital itself and expects to collect money from Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Foxconn Technology Group and the sovereign wealth fund of Kazakhstan. He also won broad support from Japanese financial institutions, with seven of them identified as signing memorandums of understanding to participate.âThe merger of Sprint with T-Mobile and Vision Fund 2, these are great milestones for SoftBank,â Son said. âThe only way from here is forward.âTo contact the reporter on this story: Pavel Alpeyev in Tokyo at palpeyev@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-07,199.04,203.43,4.39,0.022055868,Buy,2,46,811,50,6.165228113440198

The deal would give the star asset â whose stable of artists include Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and U2 â an equity valuation of 30 billion euros ($34 billion).The discussions come just over a year after Vivendi said it planned to sell as much as 50% of UMG:Â the process has been very much an adagio. An impending agreement will therefore be welcomed by shareholders.The tie-up makes a lot of sense for Vivendi, which is controlled by the billionaire Vincent Bollore. It highlights the underlying value of UMGÂ and secures a new partner that might help it expand in China.Before Tuesdayâs announcement, Vivendiâs total market capitalization was just 29 billion euros. A subsequent stock crescendo pushed that beyond the UMG valuation, but still implies thatÂ assets accounting for about 40% of profitÂ âÂ spanning the Canal+ broadcast group, Havas advertising agency, Gameloft video game studio, Editis publishing house and more â represent a far smaller fraction of the companyâs overall value.The sticker price for UMGÂ might be generous. Private equity investors had backed out earlier this year after balking at the price, Bloomberg News reported.Â  Tencentâs offer is in the middle of the broad span of valuations for the business, which ranged from as little asÂ 20 billion euros to as much as 44Â billion euros.Â Still, for the Chinese giant, 3 billion euros is a negligible price to pay for a seat at the music industryâs top tableÂ and to secure preferential treatment as itÂ expands into new markets. It has $26 billion in cash and analysts forecast $15 billion of free cash flow this year.Strategically, Tencent is a more useful partner for Vivendi than other mooted (if unlikely) investors:Â Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc.âs Google. Asia represented just 13% of UMGâs 2018 sales â thereâs plenty of room for growth. Tencent Music Entertainment Group, which the Chinese firm controls, owns some of the countryâs biggest music streaming services.Vivendi is optimistic that Tencent, with its dominant social network and keen understanding of the Chinese market, can help it expand in the region. It will be interesting to see how or if that works in practice. And other strategic players from the tech industry might be dissuaded from investing now that Tencent is involved, particularly at the same valuation.Â The concern for investors might be that this deal is the apotheosis for UMG in terms of external investment. Itâs well short of the target to sell up to half of the firm. Nonetheless, Vivendi's stock had pared gains this year, partly due toÂ concern about finding anyÂ investor at all for the label. Tencent might let the tempo pick up again.&#92;--With assistance from Tim Culpan.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Baker at stebaker@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

The S&P 500 fell nearly 3% with Monday's action. However, the opening gap and the sheer scope of the selloff since early last week sets the stage for at least some sort of bullish pushback.Source: Shutterstock Bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the charge, falling more than 5% during the regular hours session on worries that an intensifying trade war would impact it more than others. AAPL stock was down another 2% in Monday's after-hours action. Meanwhile, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was lower by more than 4% on concerns that an economic slowdown and another rate cut could prove problematic for it.Fear more than anything else, however, is what took a toll on the broad market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat doesn't mean it won't continue taking a toll though, leaving traders in something of a lurch as the week continues.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now To that end, it's the stock charts of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), AES (NYSE:AES) and Centurylink (NYSE:CTL) that appear to be best positioned for a reliable swing, even if they all still need the market's cooperation. Centurylink (CTL)Centurylink is a name that has been on the radar since the first quarter of the year. With the most recent look from mid-June, CTL had pushed above a couple of different resistance lines, and was applying pressure to its 50-day moving average line that was acting as a ceiling at the time.The 50-day moving average line has been hurdled in the meantime. In fact, it has since begun acting as support. With just a little more forward progress and a couple more technical leaps that are in the path ahead though, there's little bearish argument that will be left intact.  *   Click to EnlargeThose last two technical events that will proverbially seal the deal on new bullishness are a cross of the purple 50-day moving average above the gray 100-day average line, and a move above the recent ceiling at $12.42 plotted in blue on both stock charts.  * The odds of such a move are strong, given how Centurylink has logged higher lows and higher highs since May's pivot even though the broad market hasn't.  * Although it's not a factor yet, should CTL be able to move above the ceiling at $12.42, the next line to watch is the 200-day moving average line plotted in white on both stock charts. Pfizer (PFE)Undoubtedly it has more to do with the market and with politics than Pfizer itself. Nevertheless, the chart of the drugmaker's stock is what it is. And what it is, is a name that has been severely oversold for a bevy of reasons over the course of the past week.The sheer scope of the selloff is unusual though, setting the stage for a potential bounceback. Underscoring that prospect is where and when PFE stock finally stopped falling on Monday. It's right at one key floor, and close enough to another one to say investors are at least thinking it could be trying to act as support.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale   *   Click to EnlargeThe near-term floor in question is plotted as a falling blue line on both stock charts. Monday's low traces most of the low points seen since late last year.  * Bolstering the bearish case is the purple 50-day moving average line's cross back under the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Nevertheless, the gap left behind with last week's big plunge and the way Pfizer stock is dancing with the support line that tags all the major lows going back to early 2016 suggests this is where the bulls are most likely to take a stand. AES (AES)Finally, AES rolled higher in 2018, seemingly unaffected by the weakness that proved problematic for most other names in the last quarter of last year. This year has been a solid one for AES as well, even with the second-quarter pullback (which was a pullback from a record high).As of Monday though, AES stock is in significant technical trouble. The 3% setback was enough to pull AES stock below a couple of different key support levels. There's still a chance it could snap back into bullish mode, but should AES linger at its current value or make lower lows, there's little left to stop the bleeding.  *   Click to EnlargeOne of the critical support levels that was just shattered is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on the daily stock chart. It had been a technical floor a couple of times in recent months.  * The daily chart's action since mid-June is also telling, in a bearish way. It bounced around between two key moving average lines, but transitioned from a net-bullish to net-bearish mode on Monday.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart, the rising support level that had kept the rally in motion since turning in early 2018 finally failed to keep AES propped up with Monday's setback.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It also fell in subsequent days along with the market. Although Comcast stock offers a cheap valuation and double-digit growth, the equity is poorly positioned to deliver shareholder return at current levels. Comcast Seems SolidIn many respects, investors should congratulate the management of Comcast. Despite Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) disrupting its cable TV industry, Comcast has thrived through internet service and becoming a content provider of its own. While TV subscriptions continue to fall in line with the cord-cutting trend, the company continues to add internet customers. Moreover, as the owner of NBC as well as Universal Pictures and its theme parks, it becomes a viable competitor to Disney (NYSE:DIS).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat said, our own Josh Enomoto pointed out that Comcast stock &quot;needs some new catalysts.&quot; He could not be more right. * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now As Enomoto stated, Comcast gave investors a solid yet lackluster earnings report in July. Although the company missed on revenue, it beat Wall Street estimates and added more subscribers than analysts had expected. The company also maintained its quarterly dividend payment of 21 cents per share. This payout has risen for eight straight years and pays a yield of 2%. But CMCSA Stock Lacks an Obvious CatalystSo what?A 2% yield amounts to Comcast stock slightly beating the S&P 500 average. Like its dividend, I expect the company to continue growing, but not on an impressive scale. The company needed to replace its lagging pay-TV content with a streaming service and is doing so. Moreover, it will have to compete not only with Netflix and Disney, but also Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV service and several others.Even if Comcast's streaming service succeeds, it will not command the revenues that cable TV service brought in its heyday. Enomoto argues that Comcast stock supports less lucrative theme parks and content businesses compared to Disney. Again, I have to agree. The One Thing That Could Invigorate Comcast StockHowever, Comcast stock could have a potential catalyst in its valuation. CMCSA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 12.2. Moreover, profit growth has remained robust. Consequently, analysts expect earnings increases of 20% this year and 11.1% in fiscal 2020.This makes Comcast stock a bargain, but one I would not buy at this moment. The Federal Reserve rate cut and the escalation in the U.S.-China trade war has brought a generalized stock selloff. CMCSA will fall with almost every other stock under this circumstance.Still, its P/E ratio has averaged around 16.3 over the last five years, well above current levels. The CMCSA stock price stands just above the $41 per share level as of the time of this writing. Investors should also note the stock trades near all-time highs currently. Comcast stock bounced back in both 2016 and 2018 when it reached the low-$30s-per-share level. Hence, traders are now dealing with a range-bound equity.A return to the low-$30s-per-share floor would bring the P/E ratio into the single digits and create a buying opportunity. Moreover, if it sustained itself above the $45.30 per share all-time high and broke this price ceiling, it would probably become a buy as well.Comcast has given little indication it will generate excitement in the coming years. However, at the right price, CMCSA stock could deliver the excitement the company has not.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

1087,2172,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-defends-using-data-third-205708502.html?.tsrc=rss,"Amazon, Facebook, Google Defend Practices Amid Lawmakersâ Probe",2019-08-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.âs Google defended their business practices to U.S. lawmakers conducting a broad antitrust inquiry, seeking to underscore their companies face stiff competition in their respective industries.Amazon, for example, argued that much of the data it keeps regarding third-party merchants who use its online marketplace is public and that analyzing aggregate sales data to bolster its private-label strategy is a common practice in the retail industry.âCustomersâ shopping behavior in our store is just one of many inputs to Amazonâs private-label strategy,â David Zapolsky, Amazonâs general counsel, wrote in the letter dated July 26 to U.S. Representative David Cicilline, head of the House antitrust subcommittee. âWe also use other factors employed across the retail industry, such as fashion and shopping trends highlighted in the press and on social media, suggestions from our manufacturers for new or complementary product lines, and gaps in our product assortment relative to our competitors.âAmazon said that while it uses aggregate data from merchants, it prohibits the use of individual vendor data in its private-label strategy.The antitrust subcommittee is scrutinizing how Amazon treats its third-party sellers as part of larger probe into the technology industry. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, expressed dissatisfaction with Amazonâs answers at a July 16 hearing before the panel, especially testimony that the company doesnât use data it collects on sales to favor its products over third-party sellers. The companies, in letters released Tuesday by Cicillineâs office, responded to follow-up questions from the subcommittee.Facebook made the case that it isnât as dominant as it seems, providing Cicilline with a long list of competitors in different areas. In messaging, for example, the company said it competes with SMS texting, which is used by 4.2 billion people worldwide.Facebook also noted that itâs still possible for outside companies to gain traction quickly in social media. In 2018, TikTok, the Chinese app for short-form video owned by ByteDance Ltd., was downloaded more times than either Facebook or Instagram, becoming a âsignificant competitorâ to Facebook, the Menlo Park, California-based company said.Google maintained that it strives to give users the most relevant information as quickly as possible, which often directs them to other sites. The company also highlighted steps it takes to fight copyright infringement on its video-sharing platform, YouTube.In its response, Google also tried to refute charges that the company favors its own products in search results and on YouTube. In recent years, Google has filled search with more direct answers and Google-run services, like flight bookings, rather than links to outside websites. That trend has prompted several complaints from small companies that depend on Google traffic. Kent Walker, Googleâs chief lawyer, wrote that Google âwill deliver more traffic to sites across the web,â without citing numbers.Asked how much Google pays Apple Inc to place Google search on iPhones, Walker declined to answer.&#92;--With assistance from Sarah Frier, Ben Brody and Mark Bergen.To contact the reporters on this story: Naomi Nix in Washington at nnix1@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, ;Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-05,193.34,197.0,3.66,0.018930382,Don't move,1,14,526,16,3.041825095057034

However, the reasons behind the Tuesday bounce back are, arguably, flimsy.For example, one of today's catalysts was China saying it will not let the yuan depreciate further. That helped for today, but some market observers believe there are trust issues that need to be resolved when it comes to the U.S. and its dealings with China. Another reason equities surged today is the belief that the trade war cannot get much worse. That's a belief rooted in hope, not empirical evidence.Still, the Nasdaq Composite added 1.39% on Tuesday while the S&P 500 rose by 1.31%. Following a day in which all 30 of its components finished in the red, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a Tuesday gain of 1.22%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of today's Dow winners were of the predictable variety and that is OK. Nike (NYSE:NKE) one of the more tariff-sensitive names, jumped 2.95% today. If trade tensions ebb, the athletic apparel maker is likely to recoup some of its recent losses and then some as market participants realize Nike is much more than a China story.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Dow tech names, including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), the latter of which is highly tariff-sensitive, finished higher today. Analysts are calling attention to the fact that while the trade war is not good news for Apple, the company is prepared for it. Those preparations may not be factored into Apple stock.&quot;Apple has planned ahead for the protracted trade war and should be able to offset the costs even with higher import costs,&quot; said TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Dow Today: Boeing's BackUnfortunately, I don't mean that the stock is back, though shares of Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) gained 0.47% today. I mean that the Dow's largest component is back in this space. Boeing's recent slide, one that has seen the stock tumble 7% over the past month, has the shares residing below its key moving averages, prompting some questions about the stock's technical health.&quot;The 50-day moving average price of Boeing shares also dipped below the 200-day moving average in June--a signal technical traders will look at for signs of a shift in investor sentiment,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;When the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, it is a sign that a stock has positive momentum and that good news is propelling shares higher.&quot; Dow After The BellAs I noted yesterday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports quarterly results today after the close of U.S. markets. The stock gained 2.64% today in advance of that update. For its fiscal third quarter, Disney is expected to earn $1.72 a share on revenue of $21.4 billion. A year earlier, the company earned $1.87 a share on revenue of $15.4 billion.Disney has a history of retreating immediately following its earnings reports. If history repeats, that could be a buying opportunity in the entertainment giant's shares because the stock closed more than 10% below the average analyst price target today. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodaySomething interesting about China's effort to devalue its currency: the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSEARCA:UUP), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, is lower by a third of percent over the past week.Behind the scenes, China was likely hoping that its yuan devaluation efforts would send the dollar soaring, further crimping U.S. exporters, but that has not yet materialized. Even if the greenback gains strength on the back of the trade war, that is an impetus for the Federal Reserve to get involved and lower interest rates again, also known as good news for stocks.Todd Shriber doesn't own any of the aforementioned securities.

You see them on the cable business channels, warning, with a wild look in their eyes, of a &quot;stock market crash.&quot;Source: Shutterstock But then you look at your portfolio and note that we're in the middle of perhaps the greatest bull run in history.Plus, we've got low interest rates, an economy firing on all cylinders, and a business-friendly administration in the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently hit 27,000 for the first time ever -- and remains near record highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the bears have a point.As sure as you can count on the moon and the seasons moving in cycles, you can count on the stock market moving in cycles. It's been doing it for hundreds of years. Times of economic boom and soaring stock prices are followed by times of economic bust and plummeting stock prices.The pattern has been repeating itself since the founding of the United States.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long Economic recessionsâ¦ real estate bustsâ¦ stock market crashesâ¦ warsâ¦ financial shocks. These aren't aberrations. In fact, they are common occurrences. A quick tour of American history shows how this is the case.During the 110 years from 1900 to 2010, we've hadâ¦  * The Great Depression  * Two world wars  * More than 30 bear markets (market drops of more than 20%)  * The runaway inflation of the 1970s  * The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s  * The 2000-'02 dot-com crash  * The 2007-'08 financial crisis and resulting Great RecessionThat's not even mentioning the 22 other &quot;run of the mill&quot; recessions that cropped up along the way. Any student of economic and stock market history will tell you that massive financial shocks and stock market crashes happen a lot more often than most people think. In fact, you should expect to see at least one economic shock and bear market per decade.With this in mind, let's go back to 2007â¦ right before the stock market crashed. The 2008 Financial Crisis and Stock Market CrashIn 2007, we had a strong recovery after a crisis. We had excessive levels of debt.If that scenario sounds familiar, it's because the current economic and stock market climate has some important things in common with the one in 2007.We've recovered from a crisis and enjoyed years of good times. Student debt, consumer debt, and risky corporate debt levels are very high. And just like in 2007, stock valuations are near record highs. While the stock market could continue rising for months or even a year or more, it makes a lot of sense to create or review your plan for surviving a bear market. History shows it's just a matter of time before one strikes.While I don't think we're going to get a &quot;whopper&quot; like the 2007-'09 stock market crash anytime soon, a relatively mild drop of 25% or so is overdue.So what should you do to prepare for the next stock market crash?Smart investors prepare themselves for all possibilities -- especially when their retirement savings are at stake. Even a relatively minor market dip of 20% could set your retirement back several years or more. That's why I've put together this three-part plan to insure your investments if the stock market plunges.Knowing about and using these strategies could mean the difference between having an abundant retirement and barely getting by in your old age. Bear Market Survival Strategy 1: Diverse Asset AllocationOf all the concepts that can help you survive and thrive during tough times and full stock market crashes, few are more powerful than &quot;asset allocation.&quot;Intelligent asset allocation means you don't bet the farm on a single stock or a single asset class. Intelligent asset allocation can prevent you from suffering catastrophic losses.Consider people who went &quot;all in&quot; on real estate in 2005 and '06&#92;. Back then, the U.S. real estate mania was in full force. Real estate was a &quot;can't lose&quot; bet. Many people put all their savings into real estate and even took on loads of debt to &quot;leverage&quot; their returns.When the real estate market crashed, these all-in real-estate players were wiped out. At the heart of their downfall was poor asset allocation. They bet the farm on one asset class and it was a bubble.There's no &quot;one size fits all&quot; asset allocation strategy that is right for everyone.However, most of us have similar end goals. We want to own a diversified collection of assets that throws off lots of incomeâ¦ even when we are not actively working. We want to buy high-quality assets for bargain prices. We want our portfolio to be crisis-proof and inflation-proof. Bear Market Survival Strategy No 2: Buy Some GoldThere are hundreds of wealth-insurance policies out there. They involve intricate details, lots of forms to sign, and payments of big fees to advisors and salesmen (which are often the same thing).But I'd rather keep things simple and keep money in my pocket instead of a salesman's pocket.Put a small portion of your wealth in gold bullion.People would likely flock to gold in a global financial disaster or stock market crash and cause its price to soar. For example, the 1970s were marked by war, recession, and high inflation. This made the 1970s a terrible decade for stocks and bonds. But it was terrific for gold owners. As people fled stocks for precious metals, gold gained more than 2,000% during the decade.Stocks Zig, Gold Zags : The rolling two-year investment returns of the S&P 500 and goldThe good news is that you don't have to buy a huge amount of gold to have a good insurance policy. You can place just 5% of your portfolio into gold.Gold's place in your portfolio could be the difference between your family struggling to get by and or doing well. Bear Market Survival Strategy 3: Invest for the Long TermFinding real stock market bargains is usually difficult because financial markets correctly price most assets most of the time.However, a crisis creates massive empire-building opportunities because it introduces tremendous amounts of emotion into the financial markets.A crisis creates panic. When people panic, they dump their ownership stakes in stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities with little regard to their real values or ability to produce income. They sell first and ask questions later. This creates huge declines in asset prices and huge volatility.This, of course, means that if you can keep your head while others are losing theirs, you can buy assets at fire-sale prices.For example, the wake of the 2008 credit crisis was an amazing time to buy business like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Altria Group (NYSE:MO) (the world's largest cigarette maker), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Apple tripled in value off its 2009 bottom in less than two years. Altria doubled off its bottom in about two years. Starbucks more than tripled in value off its bottom in about two years.During a financial crisis, essential assets like factories, skyscrapers, mines, oil fields, farms, pipelines and power plants don't dry up and blow away. The only thing that changes about these valuable, lasting assets is who owns them.The financial markets are like a chess game. During a crisis, the ownership of essential assets moves from weak players to strong players. One More Way to Prepare for the Next Stock Market CrashAs I mentioned at the start of this report, it's just a matter of time before we experience another bear market or full stock market crash.That's why I've spent the past year and more developing Bear Market 2020: The Survival Blueprint.This book is full of hard-won knowledge and more advanced strategies than the ones I've shared with you so far. I've tested these tactics in the bloody trenches of firsthand investing, and in it I tell some of my &quot;war stories&quot;â¦ and prove these tactics work. Part &quot;diary&quot; and part &quot;owner's manual,&quot; Bear Market 2020 takes you by the hand and walks you, step-by-step, through the six tactics that will help you and your family navigate America's next bear market.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now History shows that it's only a matter of time before the next financial shock.

The shares have lost almost 9% over a three-day slump.In the latest development of the trade war, China let the yuan tumble to the weakest level in more than a decade and asked state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products. Wall Street analysts described the retaliation as âmassive,â calling it an â11â on a scale of one to ten.Apple has been particularly vulnerable to the trade tensions. Not only does it rely on China for key components of its supply chain, but nearly 20% of Appleâs 2018 revenue came from the country, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.âAppleâs sales in China may come under greater pressureâ after the latest development, wrote John Butler, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. He said that Apple products sold in China are priced in U.S. dollars, âsuggesting weakness in the yuan makes its devices more expensive and could dent its margins.âTo contact the reporter on this story: Ryan Vlastelica in New York at rvlastelica1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-08-05,193.34,197.0,3.66,0.018930382,Don't move,3,9,225,15,6.666666666666667
1113,2198,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-announces-earnings-week-traders-140132130.html?.tsrc=rss,Roku Announces Earnings This WeekâWhat Can Traders Expect?,2019-08-05,"Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock reports its earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 7 after the closing bell. In recent quarters, Roku has become one of the highlights of earnings season due to the extreme reactions the stock tends to bring.However, this also means traders might have to redefine &quot;disappointment&quot; for Roku stock. With an equity prone to huge moves after earnings, it is the lack of a reaction that would hurt traders more than an extreme drop.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long  A Likely Earnings Beat and Reaction in ROKU StockWall Street foresees a consensus 21 cents per share loss in Roku's second quarter. The company broke even in the same quarter last year. They also predict revenues of $224.2 million. That would represent a 43% increase from the second quarter of 2018 when the company brought in $156.81 million.Traders can (almost) count on two things when the company reports earnings. For one, Roku stock has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates in every report since its September 2017 IPO. I would not expect that to change this time.Moreover, ROKU almost always reacts strongly to these reports. The previous report led to a 28.1% one-day increase in the stock price. In February, the Roku stock price rose by 25.2% after earnings. November's third-quarter report brought a 22.3% drop in the stock. Those reactions will not go on forever. Still, it should not surprise traders to see another 20%-plus change in the stock price. Where Will ROKU Stock Go?I would not necessarily count on a higher move in the short term. Our own Nicolas Chahine described Roku stock as &quot;over the top and headed higher.&quot; I agree with that in the long-term.Roku continues to maintain its lead over competitors. In the market share for streaming, Roku stock `remains well ahead of Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the second and third-leading streaming platforms respectively.Also, given the stock's reaction to earnings in the last two quarters, I cannot discount the possibility of yet another spike higher following earnings.However, InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley's warning that investors should take profits could also prove correct. For one, ROKU trades at about 14 times sales and more than 30 times its book value. Yes, equities such as Roku stock can defy gravity for years. However, the overall market has suffered in recent trading sessions, so traders should not rule out the possibility of a massive selloff.Investors should note that it once held an advantage over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) as a neutral platform. Due to the launch of the Roku channel, that neutrality has ended. Admittedly, it has thrived by launching an advertising and streaming ecosystem. However, it remains unclear whether abandoning its neutrality will help the company. Should I Buy ROKU Stock Before Earnings?When asking whether to buy or to sell Roku stock before earnings, I would say no, except as a speculative position on both sides. What I mean by that is, ROKU is one of the few stocks where one might profit from a straddle, or buying both a call and a put option. For most equities, the cost of options right before earnings is such that most traders will lose money on such a trading strategy.The Roku stock price stands at just over $100 per share as of the time of this writing. A call option with a $100 strike price expiring on Aug. 9 (just after earnings) sells for $8.90. An equivalent put option trades at $8.17. This means that the stock will have to move more than 17% (not including fees) for a straddle bet to earn a profit.I still see that as a risky gambit much too expensive to recommend. However, investors should note that most of the one-day moves following earnings have exceeded 17%.In the long run, I see Roku stock as an equity headed much higher. However, given the overall market conditions, I foresee pain in the near term, and I would not buy at this time.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

By day's end, some 22.1 million calls and 25.8 million puts changed hands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe groundswell in put demand made a massive impact at the CBOE, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rallying to 0.87. That marks a new 2019 high and suggests capitulation is nigh. Given the bloodbath expected this morning, we could see even higher readings before a bottom is found, however. As for the 10-day moving average, it climbed to 0.69.Options traders swarmed tech stocks on Friday. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) all saw heavy options trading.Let's take a closer look: Apple (AAPL)The reversal of fortune in Apple after its earnings party has been unfortunate. The earnings numbers were good, but market-moving events like the Federal Reserve meeting and, more importantly, the latest turn in the Trade War have conspired to steal all earnings-related gains.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever With the weekend currency drama, AAPL stock is set to open down just shy of 3% to $198. That will land it at the rising 50-day moving average and provide traders with a good shot at a bounce. Here's an important reminder, however. As the market correction persists, correlations will run hot. Individual stocks will trade less on their underlying fundamentals and more on whatever the latest headline is. Absent a snapback in the broader market, AAPL will probably struggle to find its footing.On the options trading front, puts slightly outpaced calls on Friday. Total activity popped to 194% of the average daily volume, with 824,113 contracts traded. Puts accounted for 55% of the day's take.Implied volatility pushed higher to 30% placing it at the 37th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $3.83 or 1.9%. Amazon (AMZN)Amazon fell for the seventh day in a row on Friday and is now down 10% from its 2019 peak reached last month. This morning's ugliness is chopping another 2.6% off its price tag and will push the e-commerce giant deeper into oversold territory.Volume patterns are showing three consecutive distribution days ushering AMZN stock into the weekend. With institutions leaning on the sell button, it has been challenging to find a bottom. No doubt this morning's whack will bring us closer to the level of bloodletting needed for a tradable bounce to form.On the options trading front, the patterns mirrored that of Apple with puts leading the way. Activity swelled to 190% of the average daily volume, with 339,320 total contracts traded. Puts claimed 56% of the session's sum.Implied volatility has been rising during the slide, but given its extremely low starting point, it still sits in the lower end of its range. At 29%, it sits at the 21st percentile of the one-year range. That number will certainly rise this morning though. The daily expected moves are now $32.77 or 1.8%. Twitter (TWTR)Twitter may be the most impressive stock of the technology sector. It has completely sidestepped the broad market weakness, powered higher by its recent earnings release. The weekend drama is weighing it down but don't be surprised if the bearishness is short-lived. TWTR stock is set to open down 2.80%, near $41.65.Even if we see downside follow-through, multiple support zones will come into play that should bring buyers to the yard.  * 7 Big Dividend Stocks to Consider In a Low-Rate World On the options trading front, puts traded heavy despite Friday's strength. Activity jumped to 150% of the average daily volume, with 151,622 total contracts traded; 72% of the trading came from put options alone.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 40%, placing it at the 20th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.07 or 2.5%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Certainly, Nvidia stock isn't broadly considered a set-top play.Source: Shutterstock Many people are correctly certain that Nvidia isn't making a meaningful dent in the market share enjoyed first and foremost by Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and then Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and then Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Yet, Nvidia is indeed a player in the set-top streaming video receiver business, taking aim at the higher-end of the market while most other names in the business are value-minded. The Nvidia Shield TV media player retails at between $179 and $199, depending on the version being considered.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 of the Most Shorted Stocks in the Markets Right Now It's hardly a game-changer for the company. Indeed, not only is Nvidia rarely even listed on the regular market share reports that say Roku is leading the streaming hardware race, Shield TV isn't even mentioned with Nvidia's quarterly updates. Nor should it be, yet.If the goal of bothering with the minuscule venture is to plant seeds and see what happens though, the company's television-centric ambitions are laying some very interesting groundwork. Shield TV and Nvidia StockIt's a curious platform. Shield is Android-powered and functions like any other Android device. Just a few days ago its operating system began upgrades to Android 9 Pie giving users the most up-to-date functionality any user can experience with Android apps. That includes Chromecast apps, which work just fine in the typical Android environment.It's not just a streaming piece of hardware though. It's a robust computing tool in and of itself. The latest versions run on Nvidia's Tegra X1 processor (the same processor used by the Nintendo Switch), utilizing eight-core ARM tech and three gigabytes of RAM to deliver 4K UHD (2160p) pictures.It seems like overkill for a market that's mostly made up of consumers who just want a casual experience. Why bother at all just to price itself out of the market?And, such an assessment from NVDA shareholders would hold water, if the goal were simply to serve as the intermediary between content and viewer.It's possible, however, Nvidia may have something more in mind with its Shield TV than merely acting as a video-streaming platform. Shield TV Has PotentialWhat that plan may remain in question, perhaps even to Nvidia itself. But, should the purpose become crystal clear at a later date, the company is ready.We may have already seen a glimpse of that future purpose, in fact.It's not ground-breaking news to point out that the world of video gaming is changing.It began with digital downloads displacing cartridge and disc-based games but has continued on to begin the displacement of consoles as game-playing devices themselves. Indie hit Fortnite, initially needing a PC to play, has since become playable on a smartphone.Even Nvidia is making graphics-processing hardware intended to offload to the cloud the heavy-duty computing needed to play top games. It means game-streaming services like Stadia, now in development by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), can be played on even a low-quality machine.It's been rumored, in fact, that Nvidia is specifically developing support to power Google's Stadia games played on Shield TV devices.The prospect isn't a stretch. Shield TV devices can already be purchased with a gamepad, for the purpose of playing Android-based games. Cloud-based game streaming outside of Android's ecosystem is increasingly common as well. It's the shape of things to come. Shield TV and Nvidia Stock DownsidesIt's difficult to call Nvidia's Shield TV a game console, of course, but it's also difficult to say it's not one. That's a good reason for concern.Consumers have seen such hybrids fail before. The Android-powered Ouya was released in 2012 to a lukewarm and mostly confused reception. The console and its back-end support finally shuttered for good earlier this year, having never found the sliver of the market that wants a decent game console and a streaming device in one, but is unwilling to spend the $400 or even $500 needed to purchase an Xbox or PlayStation.It may have been a device that materialized before its time though. Stadia and other cloud/streaming game platforms possibly could have kept the Ouya afloat if they were around seven years ago.It may have also been a device that lacked the big-name backing needed to inject such a device into a crowded space. Nvidia wouldn't face such a problem.And yet, gaming is still not necessarily all that Shield TV brings to the table. Bottom Line for Nvidia StockAgain, don't look for NVDA shares to be catapulted anytime soon by its subtle entry into muddied console/streaming-box waters. Nvidia doesn't seem to care all that much about the business and is instead focusing on more pressing opportunities like discreet GPUs and artificial intelligence. That's as it should be.Still, in that nobody truly knows how (or even if) consumers are going to be demanding a different kind of engagement when cloud-based gaming becomes the norm, this budding technology should be factored into the long-term outlook for Nvidia stock.NewZoo says gamers will spend nearly $140 billion on their pastime this year. Offering a high-powered, multi-purpose platform that can handle even the most intense games wouldn't be a bad way for Nvidia to capture a piece of that market.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But QCOM stock watchers called the company's guidance &quot;disappointing&quot; because it stripped out its business with China's Huawei from the results.The shares lost about $3 on the news and ended the week just above $71 after touching $76.25 on July 29. This pushes the yield on the 62 cent per share dividend to 3.48%. The 30-year U.S. government bond currently yields just 2.49%.The numbers, however, have little to do with Qualcomm's business and more to do with its status as a legal and political pinata.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Qualcomm for AmericaAs I wrote on July 22, Qualcomm's legal claim linking patents to chip sales is now fully supported by the Trump administration, despite negative reaction from a court.Three agencies -- the Departments of Energy, Justice and Defense -- are now on the record arguing that legal action against the monopoly threatens national security.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels The decision by U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh, an Obama appointee, calling Qualcomm's &quot;no patent, no chips&quot; practice illegal, continues to be fought by the administration, with letters to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals asking for a stay of the decision.  Qualcomm for ChinaDespite administration rhetoric calling Qualcomm a bulwark against China's tech ambitions, Qualcomm continues to do business there. If anything, it's even more deeply involved with the world's second-biggest economy than ever before.Qualcomm recently signed a deal with Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) to collaborate on digital entertainment. This could result in the two companies jointly developing a mobile gaming device or smartphone. That's important as gaming shifts to online and mobile platforms, where Tencent is a clear leader.Qualcomm is also working with China to make 5G the standard communication system for self-driving cars. NXPI (NASDAQ:NXPI), which Qualcomm tried to buy last year, is behind a rival standard based on WiFi. A win for Qualcomm here could bring tens of billions of dollars in royalty payments down the road. The Legal DiscountHow well Qualcomm's doing depends a lot on whether you use GAAP or non-GAAP measurements.The former, which counts cash in escrow under legal dispute as income, shows the company earning $2.1 billion, or $1.75 per share of QCOM stock fully diluted, on revenue of $9.6 billion during the most recent quarter. Under non-GAAP accounting Qualcomm said it will earn just 65 cents-75 cents per share next quarter on $4.2-5.1 billion of revenue.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 In its latest report the company estimated it will get $4.7 billion from the settlement of its dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and those revenues are included in its GAAP calculations. Apple recently bought most of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) smartphone modem business for $1.2 billion, and plans to eventually replace Qualcomm modems with its own.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf also said his company has yet to reach a final agreement with Huawei, so its outlook doesn't include those payments. He said Chinese carriers won't start launching 5G services until next year, eliminating a normal seasonal earnings boost. He predicted they will start seeing the full benefits of 5G in the first quarter of 2020. Bottom Line on QCOM StockThe uncertainty over China and its legal status means QCOM stock continues to be range-bound. Many analysts don't know what to think. What presents as a tech stock is trading like a law firm.The result is a bargain for income-oriented investors. Qualcomm easily out-earns its dividend and continues to accumulate cash. It also has more than $14 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books, meaning 34% of its assets are liquid. With older investors increasingly desperate for yield, this looks like an opportunity.For other investors, it looks like a speculation.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

In fact, MSFT stock is up nearly 40% this year. Microsoft is an appealing company for investors because the growth in its underlying businesses has allowed Microsoft to generate massive amounts of cash flows. Microsoft is a high-quality company because it generates a massive amount of cash, has phenomenal dividend growth and it is not in the anti-trust cross-hairs as many other large companies are.Source: Shutterstock With all of that in mind, let's take a deeper look into each of these positive aspects that make Microsoft stock an appealing pick for any portfolio. MSFT Cash FlowsThere's an old saying -- &quot;cash is king&quot; -- and I view MSFT as the king in that regard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs of the end of the most recent quarter, Microsoft had over $130 billion in cash on its balance sheet. In addition, over the last four quarters, Microsoft has generated $38 billion in free cash flow. The substantial amount of cash on the balance sheet and cash generated by the business allows Microsoft to pay increasing dividends and invest in future growth areas. For example, Microsoft recently invested $1 billion in OpenAI and had another initiative to train 15,000 people in AI-related skills by 2022. This shows Microsoft is investing in what will be one of the most important technological areas in the coming decades.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond  Stellar Dividend  Click to Enlarge Source: Zacks Investment Research The dividend for Microsoft is one of the safest if not the safest dividends in the market. The reason for this is the large amount of cash on the balance sheet, cash flow generation and the fact Microsoft is one of only two AAA rated companies. Going forward, I expect that Microsoft will continue to increase their dividend at a rate of 8-10% per year, with the next increase likely announced in mid-September.  Click to Enlarge Source: Zacks Investment Research Even with the stellar dividend and stable dividend-growth, the dividend yield for MSFT stock is only 1.31%. The reason for the low dividend is that the stock has moved up in price so much this year. The following chart shows the dividend yield for Microsoft is at a historically low level. I expect that when Microsoft announces a dividend increase in September, it will be a quarterly dividend around 50 cents per share.Since the beginning of 2018, the dividend yield has ranged from 2% to the current 1.30%. If Microsoft were to return to the mid-point of that range at a yield of 1.65% with a potential quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, that would imply a stock price of around $121. I believe a pullback would be healthy for the stock and create an opportunity for potential investors. Microsoft Eludes Current Anti-Trust TroublesEven though Microsoft has a $1 trillion market cap, they were left off the list of companies that are coming under scrutiny from Washington D.C. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all in the cross-hairs for various reasons.Since Microsoft is not in the cross-hairs, it makes MSFT stock a compelling pick to consider. For example, if the regulators/anti-trust authorities have a problem with one of those four companies and an investor sells out of their position, investors are likely to strongly consider moving those funds to Microsoft to maintain their large-cap technology exposure. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe bottom line is that Microsoft is a high quality company that generates massive amounts of cash, has superior shareholder returns and as of right now, is not in the anti-trust cross-hairs. The one drawback for Microsoft stock is its price, shares are expensive and, as I noted the above, the dividend yield is toward the low end of its historical range, which means waiting for a better entry point may be warranted.As of this writing, Brad Kenagy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1144,2229,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cheap-stocks-buy-prices-143237163.html?.tsrc=rss,3 Cheap Stocks to Buy Before Prices Soar,2019-08-01,"It's hard to find cheap stocks when the stock markets are near all-time highs. Yesterday, though, the Federal Reserve announced that it cut overnight lending rates. They also announced that they accelerated ending the quantitative tightening two months earlier than scheduled, showing they are committed to sprucing up the economy and the stock markets.This should have sparked a rally. However, in the question-and-answer session, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell did not choose his words carefully. He caused a -1% selloff in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.When something like that happens, I look for cheap stocks to buy. This may turn out to be an opportunity for the bulls. So I stay bullish or add some longs if I need them on the small dip. Even though Powell may have spooked Wall Street, he didn't change the fact that they are still dovish and in a stimulative mode.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks Under $10 Within that narrative, today we examine three cheap stocks on my list of buys for the next few years: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). GOOGL stock is lagging the S&P 500 by two points, but the other two stocks to buy are up more than the S&P by over 60%. Apple (AAPL)Apple reported earnings yesterday and they beat on all metrics. More importantly, management was bullish about their progress in the &quot;services&quot; area, which is the new buzzword for Wall Street. AAPL stock soared on the headline.Even though the iPhone sales were less-than-ideal, the revenues from services are huge and exceed the sales of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for example.Even though Tim Cook is not known for his innovation, under his leadership Apple stock is rising on something other than the iPhone. This is a good thing even though it might upset a few critics. The company still has a good runway for the next few years regardless of skeptics' opinions.Fundamentally, AAPL stock is still too cheap. It sells at 18 price-to-earnings ratio and pays a 1.5% dividend. Apple stock gets little respect from that perspective. Maybe with the shift in focus away from the iPhone in its evaluation, it will bring about more credit on Wall Street for prices in AAPL stock.In any case, owning Apple shares here makes sense for the long-term. Because if the general markets are higher down the line, then so is AAPL stock. It's the prime example of cheap stocks.In addition to the fundamentals, the AAPL stock technicals are also bullish. There is an ongoing pattern with a target that could send the stock to $250 per share or higher in the next few months. So if I have the stock I stay in it. If not, then I can start a position to capture the move.Owning shares of Apple at these levels is not likely to be a financial debacle. The stock will be higher down the line if one is patient enough. Alphabet (GOOGL)Like AAPL, Alphabet stock also doesn't get the respect it deserves on Wall Street. Even if they have managed to create capital appreciation in the stock price without much financial engineering. The Google cash position is now stronger than that of Apple, which doesn't get much coverage in the media.GOOGL is a company that still dominates all search. It does have significant competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but the management team is savvy enough to handle that. Besides, there is enough room for all three to coexist. The digitization and mobile trends are growing exponentially and there will be enough business to go around.In addition to search, Google has many other ventures, most notably the Waymo self-driving company. This will eventually become another cash cow for GOOGL and a large contributor for more upside in Google stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Just like Apple, owning Alphabet stock at these levels is not going to be a financial debacle in the long run. Buying cheap stocks that dominate their verticals is never wrong. Disney (DIS)Disney recently announced their foray into media streaming. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) established the fact that consumers want to consume their media through streaming and DIS is finally jumping on the bandwagon.Disney severed ties with Netflix to create their own competitive platform. They are slated to release it later this year and I definitely want to be long DIS stock when that happens.The subscription pricing is low enough that I bet that the metrics for adoption of this new Disney platform will blow away all estimates. DIS stock, even though it's not an obvious example of cheap stocks, should take a leap higher even from these elevated levels. Wall Street has already adjusted the price level for Disney but I don't think they set it high enough.Disney stock still sells at 16 P/E ratio and it pays 1.2% dividend yield. And just like AAPL and GOOG, this is way too low and doesn't give any credence to the quality of the management teams.DIS is a global company with assets known to everyone. There is not one soul on this planet that doesn't know the House of Mouse. Disney content will be readily available and it's just a matter of them turning on the faucet.AAPL, GOOGL and DIS stocks are proven winners and will continue to lead the stock markets higher. The upside potential in the next few years is much higher than the downside risks.Since we are still in headline-trading mode with a full economic war still raging, I don't take full positions all at once. It is best to take them in tranches and leave room to add later.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

After it reported second-quarter earnings two weeks ago -- with a loss of domestic subscribers, narrow revenue miss and half the expected new subscribers globally -- NFLX stock took a pounding.Source: Flickr via Mike K.Shockingly, $16 billion was lopped from the company's market capitalization in the bloodbath. Netflix stock hit a six-month low a week ago, closing at $307.30 last Tuesday, but then began three-day climb. That streak came to an end on Monday, when NFLX lost 0.92% on the day.The question is, will this turn out to be a hiccup in the recovery, or is NFLX stock likely to fall even further in 2019?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q2 Earnings Impact Still Being FeltAfter the awful numbers from Q2, the shock is still rippling throughout the investment community. Raising prices to boost earnings or to bring in more cash to spend on programming clearly is a risky option.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August That's because boosting U.S. subscriptions by $2 monthly cost the company 126,000 subscribers. For perspective, this is the first decrease in U.S. subscribers for Netflix since 2011. Adding to the woes, the five million new international customers Netflix expected turned into 2.7 million.With analysts expecting domestic subscribers to increase by over 350,000 and NFLX missing its own global adds by 2.3 million, it's no wonder NFLX stock got hammered. And those misses are still weighing on investors.Is there any hope of a better performance in the next quarter? In its Q3 guidance, Netflix says it expects U.S. paid subscribers to &quot;return to more typical growth.&quot; In addition, the company projects an additional seven million new subscribers globally. That reassurance helped make the case for last week's Netflix stock recovery, after the bloodbath immediately following the earnings report. Big Competition AheadOn their own, the Netflix Q2 numbers have been troubling to many investors. But what added gasoline to the bloodbath in Netflix stock was the looming competition.For years, Netflix has been the undisputed king of streaming video. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in the game as well, along with a handful of smaller services. But it hasn't exactly been tough slogging for NFLX. However, the company's success has not gone unnoticed. Starting this fall, tech, communications and entertainment companies will launch a series of high-profile new video streaming services.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is spending big on Apple TV+. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will launch its Disney+ video streaming service in November for just $6.99 per month. Furthermore, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have new video streaming services coming from their WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal divisions, respectively.Making the situation even tougher for NFLX stock? It's not only going to be facing a future where it must compete hard for subscribers, Netflix will go head-to-head against streaming services that will own some of its most popular current content.The two most-watched shows on Netflix (by a wide margin) are The Office and Friends. They will move to the competition. Add the exodus of Disney content including Marvel and Star Wars movies, and Netflix will face a real challenge hanging onto subscribers, let alone adding more. Is NFLX Stock Overvalued?The Q2 earnings report, the pending competition and the loss of critical content all come together into one question: is NFLX stock overvalued?After all, NFLX has increased in value by over 5000% over the past decade, even after the Q2 earnings bloodbath. In comparison, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- which is now a trillion dollar company and firing on all cylinders after years of stumbling -- is up 500% in the same decade. And while MSFT trades at a price-earnings ratio near 28%, Netflix has a sky high 130% P/E ratio.With growth slowing, competition increasing dramatically and Netflix still up 24% on the year, last week's NFLX stock recovery may turn out to be short lived.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1168,2253,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-subscriber-gains-beat-expectations-102356219.html?.tsrc=rss,Spotifyâs Premium Subscriber Growth Trails Some Estimates,2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Spotify Technology SA reported slightly slower subscriber growth than investors had hoped for its fiscal second quarter, overshadowing revenue gains and a narrower loss.The music-streaming company ended the most recent quarter with 108 million subscribers to its premium service, a shade below the 108.5 million forecast by analysts and below the midline of Spotifyâs internal forecast.âWe missed on subs. Thatâs on us,â Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on a conference call. He said the shortfall was related to execution, in particular the failure to market a plan for students, and the streaming giant plans to make up the lost ground by year-end.The shares fell as much as 6.1% in New York trading before paring declines, closing down 0.2% to $154.94. The stock has gained 37% this year.Investors have high expectations for Spotify, the worldâs largest paid online music service, and have sent shares down after almost all of its earnings reports as a public company. Spotify came in at the higher end of forecasts for most of its financial metrics, including sales and profit.âThis company is owned for subscriber beats and while management is likely to sound positive on the call, the subscriber miss is unlikely to be forgiven,â Lynx Equity Strategies analyst Jahanara Nissar wrote in a note.Competition WorriesInvestors have worried competition from Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.âs YouTube would slow Spotifyâs growth. But Spotify said its subscribers grew 31% compared with a year ago, about double the rate of Apple Music, its closest competitor.Spotifyâs overall user base grew to 232 million, above Wall Street projections of about 227 million and the companyâs guidance for a range of 222 million to 228 million. Most of those people use the free, advertising-supported version of the service.Barry McCarthy, Spotifyâs chief financial officer, at first dismissed the brief downturn before saying investors may have expected a higher number.âThere could have been a baked-in whisper number we donât know about,â McCarthy said. âThere are times when investors are looking south instead of north and miss the forest through the trees.âSpotify said it has reached agreement with two of four major record labels regarding licenses. Getting to long-term profitability from the current losses will hinge in a big way on the new royalty arrangements the company is negotiating with major music labels. Music companies collect the majority of Spotifyâs monthly sales.Deals RestructuredSpotify restructured the deals such that it can create new tools and services -- new sources of revenue -- that are free from labelsâ guaranteed cut of sales. McCarthy described it as an important win.The Stockholm-based company reported a second-quarter loss of 42 cents a share, narrower than the year-earlier loss of $2.20 a share. Analysts expect quarterly losses at least through the third quarter of 2020.Podcasts may help Spotifyâs push for profitability. Spotify has redesigned its app to boost listenership of non-music programming, and spent about $400 million to acquire podcasting companies this year. The company has backed the production of original podcasts such as âJemele Hill Is Unbotheredâ and âThe Two Princes.â Though Apple is the dominant podcasting platform in the U.S., Spotify has increased its share and staked out a leading position in some international territories.Growth outside the U.S. will be key if Spotify is to keep investors happy. The company still relies on North America and Europe for more than half of its customers, while those regions account for less than one-quarter of the global population. âOverall we are still in the growth phase of the business,â Ek said.(Updates with closing share price in fourth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Kamaron Leach and Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, John J.

1177,2262,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-acquisitions-probed-ftc-broad-200518661.html?.tsrc=rss,Facebook Acquisitions Probed by FTC in Broad Antitrust Inquiry,2019-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing acquisitions by Facebook Inc. as part of an early stage antitrust investigation of the social media platform, according to people familiar with the matter.The agencyâs look at whether the company acquired upstarts to thwart competition is part of the broad probe into into several business lines -- social media, digital advertising and mobile applications -- that Facebook disclosed in July.The commission has contacted third parties that could aid in the investigation as it tries to understand competitive dynamics, Bloomberg reported. The people asked not to be named because the inquiry is confidential.Facebook and the FTC declined to comment. The agencyâs scrutiny of Facebookâs acquisitions was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.The Trump administration is escalating antitrust scrutiny of technology giants. Last month, the Justice Departmentâs antitrust division announced a broad review into whether the companies are using their power to thwart competition. In February, the FTC set up a task force to investigate potentially anticompetitive conduct in the industry and look at past mergers to determine if they should be unwound.Trump DOJ Escalates Big Tech Scrutiny With New Antitrust ProbeFacebookâs critics, including co-founder Chris Hughes, have called for antitrust enforcers to break up the company, arguing it shouldnât have been allowed to buy Instagram and the WhatsApp messaging service. Both deals were approved by the agency when they were announced, and persuading a court to undo them would be a steep challenge, according to antitrust experts.If the FTC decided to bring a lawsuit to unwind the deals -- despite having approved them -- it would need to show that Facebook eliminated competitors by buying the apps. Facebook would counter that the companies only flourished because of the resources they gained from being part of the social-media company.When Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, the photo-sharing app had just 30 million users. At the time, Facebook had lost almost half its value since its initial public offering earlier that year amid investor concerns about whether it could make money from the mobile version of its service. Now Facebook has 2.4 billion monthly active users, and Instagram has more than 1 billion.Facebook has made dozens of acquisitions over the years, though only a handful are well known. In 2014, it bought WhatsApp for $19 billion before picking up Oculus, a maker of virtual reality headsets, for $2 billion just a month later. Virtual reality hasnât captured a mainstream audience the way Facebook hopes it will, but WhatsApp has taken off. While it still doesnât generate big profits for Facebook, itâs amassed more than 1.5 billion users around the world.Far From Silicon Valley, Trustbusters Plotted Big Tech AssaultâThere are a lot of other transactions that Facebook has engaged in that the FTC could say, âWell look, allowing these transactions was a mistake,ââ said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the media policy group Public Knowledge.Although the company may not worry because a breakup is less likely than other moves such as privacy legislation, itâs arguably the most scary option for Facebook in Washington, Feld said. Even an investigation could prove damaging, he added.âHow long is this going to go on?â Feld said. âHow expensive is it going to be and how much is this going to cramp your style?âFacebook has argued repeatedly that breaking up the company wonât fix the tech industryâs biggest problems -- those around election integrity and user privacy.

1185,2270,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/signs-end-tech-slump-offer-210000376.html?.tsrc=rss,Signs of an End to the Tech Slump Offer Hope to Asiaâs Economies,2019-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- The worst may soon be over for an electronics slump that has dogged Asiaâs export-driven economies.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists said a rebound in technology exports is overdue, citing gradual improvement in South Korean trade and evidence the memory-chip cycle is reaching its low point.While South Korean semiconductor shipments plunged 28% by value in July, they rose 15% by volume. The nationâs inventories of semiconductors fell a second straight month in June, a sign that orders are picking up.âThe question is when South Koreaâs exports will bottom out,â said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul. âIt could be the third quarter, either August or September.âThe slump in tech exports has been one of the biggest drags on Asiaâs manufacturing base. Key gauges for factory sentiment continue to show contractions for output in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. Real investment growth across Asia slowed to 2% in the first quarter from 7% a year ago, according to S&P Global Ratings.Industry announcements across Asia signal a possible recovery, which is good news for a region that accounts for more than 60% of global economic growth.Samsung Electronics Co., the worldâs biggest memory-chip maker, said Wednesday that data centers -- its biggest customers -- have started buying again, causing demand to increase.The worldâs largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., surprised analysts last month when it projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates. TSMCâs business has bottomed out and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said. The Apple Inc. supplier sees âvery, very strong demandâ in the second half of 2019, he said.Smartphone DemandAppleâs suppliers -- dominated by Asia-based factories -- are preparing to produce components for up to 75 million new iPhones in the second half, roughly the same number as a year earlier, Bloomberg News reported.Appleâs sales forecast of $61 billion-$64 billion for the current quarter not only topped analystsâ estimates but also signaled year-over-year revenue could grow, thanks to healthy demand for iPhones.Another reason for optimism is that Samsung will begin selling its Galaxy Fold smartphone in September. The worldâs biggest handset maker hopes the foldable phones, coupled with fifth-generation wireless networks, will kick the mobile industry back into a boom by giving consumers a compelling reason to upgrade their devices.âItâs been pretty awful but probably not as bleak going forward as it has been,â Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said of the tech cycle.Early DaysFor sure, itâs too early to say for certain the worst is over.After all, Singaporeâs electronics exports fell in June to their lowest since at least 1997. In Japan, shipments of electronic components and chip-making equipment to China both dropped by well over 20% in June.Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore, said that while the electronics sector may bottom late this year, âsignificant downside risks remain.âIn addition to the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing global economy, demand for new smartphones is plateauing. Rising tensions between Japan and South Korea could also hurt. Japan has already slapped curbs on exports to South Korea of materials vital to manufacturing of semiconductors and displays, and things could get worse.âEven before the trade war hit, there was a bit of a moderation in the tech cycle,â said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. âSmartphones have reached a saturation point.âStill, optimists argue that comparisons with robust growth numbers for electronics exports from a year ago is making the weakness look worse than it is.Beyond smartphones, Asia is also leading spending on the Internet of Things, accounting for around 36% of global spending this year, followed by the U.S. and Western Europe with 27% and 21%, respectively.âInitial shocks from the trade war might be behind us,â Goldman economists wrote in a note.&#92;--With assistance from Debby Wu.To contact the reporters on this story: Enda Curran in Hong Kong at ecurran8@bloomberg.net;Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net;Sam Kim in Seoul at skim609@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Malcolm Scott at mscott23@bloomberg.net, Henry Hoenig, Nasreen SeriaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-31,213.04,208.43,-4.61,-0.021639129,Sell,2,36,692,40,5.780346820809249

1193,2278,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-china-trade-war-may-191917219.html?.tsrc=rss,U.S.-China Trade War May Finally Be Coming for Apple,2019-07-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. executives have for months been publicly optimistic that everything will turn out fine in the trade battle between the U.S. and China. Well, maybe not.President Donald Trump on Thursday tweeted â of course âÂ that the U.S. plans to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of goods imported from China. SmartphonesÂ are among the consumer products that havenât been subject to earlier tariffÂ rounds, but itâs fair to assume they will be if the U.S. moves ahead with duties on all remaining Chinese imports.Â Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook likes to say that Appleâs smartphones are products of the world, and they are. But the bulk of iPhoneÂ manufacturing and assembly takes placeÂ in China. That means the U.S.-China trade war may finally be coming for Apple,Â and it shows that Cookâs personal diplomacy with the White House and in Beijing didnât necessarily spare his company.Â If Trump imposes the fresh tariffs andÂ Apple raises prices in response on the estimated 70Â million or so iPhones sold in the U.S. each year, it most likely wonât crater sales, but it wonât be great for an already fragile smartphone market. Apple shares were trading down about 2% after Trumpâs tweet.Â Shipments of smartphones have been falling globally, and signs have continued that people in the U.S. and some other countries are holding onto their phones for longer. AT&T Inc. said recently that a record-low share of its wireless monthlyÂ customers, just 3.3%, opted to buy a new smartphone model in the second quarter. Apple has been trying to lower iPhone prices through various means, and that might be tough if the company has to figure out how to manage a 10% tariff, too.Appleâs only significant smartphone rival in the U.S., Samsung Electronics Co.,Â spreads its manufacturing assembly around the world a bit more than Apple does. Itâs not clear how many of Samsungâs smartphones sold in the U.S. might be subject to fresh U.S. tariffs.Â Apple investors have been well aware of the risk of tariffs landing on the companyâs doorstep, but the company has essentially told them not to worry. U.S. tariffs didnât come up in Appleâs quarterly earnings call this week. In prior sessions, Cook and other executives have sounded confident that trade negotiations between the U.S. and China were improving and would eventually be resolved amicably.âI canât predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this, and we are hoping that calm heads prevail,â Cook told investors last year. He has echoed those comments at several points since then.Â That optimism has meant that Apple hasÂ said little publicly about its potential hit from tariffs, whether it would pass along costs to consumers or absorb them, or what steps it might take to mitigate the impact, such as moving some manufacturing out of China. (Appleâs primary iPhone manufacturing partner,Â Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has talked aboutÂ having the capacity to make iPhones outside of China.)Â Itâs also possible that if tariffs are imposed on iPhones in the U.S., there will be ripple effects, such as China â one of Appleâs most important consumer markets â retaliating in some way against Apple products. Appleâs army of suppliers may feel the impact, too. Thatâs all toÂ say that even if Apple is well prepared for the potential arrival of tariffs on its most important product,Â the companyâs investors and most likely some of its many partners do notÂ necessarily know about those preparations.Â Optimism is the attitude of a healthy person. But caution, or at least an indication that Apple has a sensible plan B, may have been a better strategy when dealing with uncertain geopolitical fights.Â To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide at sovide@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

I've lost money in Apple. I've missed its most spectacular moves up and, ignoring conventional wisdom, stayed for some of its most shuddering falls.I had bought soon after its disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report last November, after it had dropped from its all-time high of $230 to a more comfortable $209 per share. Since then it has been at $146 in December, and $175 last month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy finger hovered, but it stayed up. I decided to wait on the earnings report. It was a winner. Apple stock rose to $219.This taught me an important lesson, one worth sharing.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends  When It Comes to AAPL Stock, RelaxApple is what you call a &quot;core holding,&quot; because the iPhone represents an inflection point in the global economy.Before the late Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, the internet was a desktop thing. You reached people with the phone network. You bought things by walking into stores.That world is hard to even comprehend now. The iPhone, and its competitors, have made everyone part of the world market. Africans, South Asians, people in what were the most remote quarters of the globe, are now instantly accessible over the internet. They're part of the global conversation.This has dropped the cost of doing business to the floor. The productivity of the smartphone, combined with the cloud, has destroyed millions of jobs, putting whole industries on their back.You don't fight that. You don't time that. You just put some money into it and go about your business.When Jobs spoke, Apple had 12-month trailing revenues of $27 billion. In 2018, revenue was $265 billion. Under Tim Cook, who took over after Jobs' death in 2011, some quarters have shown year-over-year sales falling by as much as 14%.  But if you just sat tight, you have a gain of 685%, you have 7 times more shares than you did and you have a steady stream of dividends. Ignore the NoiseWe live in revolutionary times. Clouds and devices like the iPhone are the revolution.The companies behind this revolution represent core holdings you should maintain. Don't buy or sell a core holding. Just sit on it. Ignore the noise.Other companies I consider core at this time are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Visa (NYSE:V) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A big bank like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should be there, maybe Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). You can argue for Square (NASDAQ:SQ) or Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW).I don't hold all these stocks, but I leave the ones I do own alone. I ignore the headlines. I treat them like a piggy bank. I'll open it when I need it, not before. I'll let time do its magic for me. The Bottom Line on Apple StockThe deflationary impact of clouds and devices are the most important change of this decade.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond You must be in the stocks leading this revolution, even if it means having a portfolio that leans more heavily into technology than previously.There will be other revolutions coming, because clouds and devices accelerate the pace of all change -- social, political and economic. Given the state of the climate, that's the only hope I can give your grandchildren.Apple leads the device side of the revolution. The Apple Watch will open almost as many opportunities as the iPhone did, once its capabilities break beyond Apple's walled garden, into the larger mass market.Core holdings aren't perfect companies. But just ignore the noise and hold them. Your patience will be rewarded.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

1208,2293,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-amazon-pouring-investments-173112893.html?.tsrc=rss,Why Apple and Amazon Are Pouring Investments Into Solar Energy,2019-07-31,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lead the list of U.S. commercial solar installation, according to &quot;Solar Means Business,&quot; a newly released report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).Apple tops the list, with 393 megawatts (MW) installed in the last three years, and Amazon comes in second, with 330 MW installed. Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also in the top 10.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, according to the study, 2018 ranks as the second-largest year for commercial solar installations, with 1,144 MW installed. And the biggest news SEIA shared is that &quot;more than half of all corporate solar capacity has been installed in the last three years.&quot;Clearly, the solar industry is gaining momentum. And that momentum is building at the exact same moment that global demand for solar power is about to go parabolic.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August I've been studying and investing in the solar market for several years now. And as far as I see it, two catalysts are fueling the solar boom.First, I'll show you these three profit triggers -- and then I'll show you how to profit from them. Solar Profit Trigger No. 1: Falling Costs, Rising EfficiencyThe cost of solar-power installations has been plummeting -- in both the residential and utility-scale markets. In many parts of the world, solar power is still more expensive than conventional power-generation technologies, but the gap is closing very rapidly.According to the SEIA report, U.S. solar costs have fallen by 65% over the last decade. In 2009, on average, installing a solar panel cost $8.50 per watt. Now its costs just a little less than $3.Meanwhile, solar-panel efficiency has skyrocketed over the past decade or so.In 1954, when Bell Labs invented the first useful silicon solar panel, they were about 6% efficient. We didn't achieve 20% efficiency until the mid-2010s, less than five years ago. Today, manufacturers are making panels with 30% efficiency.And they've reached 45% efficiency in the lab. Solar Profit Trigger No. 2: The Big Boys Step InFurther, the true cost comparison between solar power and other technologies involves more than just dollars and cents. Clearly, the toxic emissions that spew from coal-fired plants impose a cost on the planet that solar panels do not.That's why India and China -- the two most populous, and two of the most polluted, countries on the planet -- are ramping up their solar-power capacity.Both of these countries have devoted themselves to solar power, like teenagers to tattoos, and both countries have laid out ambitious plans to expand their solar footprints.Of course, sinking costs, rising efficiency and the burgeoning demand for solar power from China and India are not the only reasons to expect global demand to soar over the next several yearsâ¦ Solar Profit Trigger No. 3: The X FactorA powerful new &quot;X factor&quot; has entered the solar energy market -- and it has the potential to supercharge demand.That X factor is energy storage (aka batteries).Until recently, solar-power installations lacked the ability to store energy. They were simply use-it-or-lose-it power generators. Energy storage technologies were too expensive to be viable additions to solar-power facilities.But this old story is changing rapidly. Energy storage has arrived - and its arrival could be a very big deal for the solar industry.In the &quot;olden days&quot; of 2015, a company like Target would contract with a solar company to install solar panels on the roofs of its superstores. Once installed, the panels would deliver daytime electricity to supplement the electricity Target pulled from the regional power grid.But now, when Target installs new rooftop panels, it often also installs a battery system to store the excess energy it doesn't use immediately.In 2017, Target kicked off its solar-storage project at its store in Kailua-Kona, on the big island of Hawaii's east coast. There it installed a 910-kilowatt solar system from SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) that included a 250-kilowatt energy storage component.This may have been the first time a Target store had added energy storage to solar -- but it won't be the last.By the end of this year, Target expects to install rooftop solar systems on more than 500 store locations. And by 2030, the company plans to meet 100% of its energy needs from renewable sources.Utilities are also embracing energy storage. Increasingly, they are opting to add new generating capacity by building energy-plus-storage facilities, rather than gas- or coal-fired power plants.Last year, for example, the Arizona Public Service committed to deploying 850 megawatts (MW) of energy storage over the next six years. Along the same lines, NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced plans to deploy a 409 MW solar-plus-storage solution at Florida Power & Light Co., replacing two gas-fired power plants.Looking globally, the deployment of battery-based energy storage solutions (BESS) is ramping up quickly. According to JPMorgan, the cumulative installed base of BESS will soar 100-fold between now and 2030.The bottom line: Solar is big - and getting bigger. A $4 Trillion OpportunityAt the end of 2018, the world's installed capacity of solar-power generation totaled nearly half a billion megawatts -- accounting for more than 7% of the globe's power capacity.But new capacity installations are on track to soar 25% this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and to nearly double by 2021.Many forecasts anticipate an equally spectacular growth trajectory. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) &quot;Sustainable Development Scenario,&quot; solar-power capacity will soar fivefold between now and 2025, accounting for a whopping 38% of global power generation.Looking further out, the IEA anticipates a 13-fold increase in solar-power capacity by 2040, at which point this renewable source would be providing two-thirds of the world's power needs.The IEA anticipates global spending on solar power to total $4 trillion over the next two decades -- or about $180 billion per year.If investment of this magnitude were to occur, solar power would become the world's primary electricity source by 2040.But you don't have to wait 20 years to profit on this trend.There are a lot of companies out there that are jumping on the solar bandwagon, and there is clearly a lot of investing potential here.But it's all about finding the right companies that offer significant long-term potential.That's why I've just released a special &quot;all solar&quot; edition of my brand-new newsletter - Fry's Investment Report.In it, I share two recommendations to get investors in on this technology's profit ground floor.To learn more, I strongly suggest you go here to find out how to join Fry's Investment Report.Eric Fry is thhttps://orders.investorplace.com/chain?cid=MKT410381&eid=MKT419624&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=starte resident expert on global investment trends at InvestorPlace. And he and his members have been experiencing much success when it comes to solar over the past year or so. In late October 2018, Eric recommended buying some call options on a solar-focused exchange-traded fund. By late January, that ETF had soared more than 30%. (Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 Index advanced just 3%.) The way Eric played it, readers who followed his advice ended up making 203% on their entire position - in just a smidgeon over three months. And in early October 2018, Eric suggested they get in on a certain solar stock's call options. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed more than 75%. They've closed out the first third of that option trade for 168% gainsâ¦ and the second third for gains of 282%. And they're still sitting on 200%+ gains with the final third of that trade.

1214,2299,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-outlook-weighed-down-weak-205519407.html?.tsrc=rss,Qualcomm Outlook Weighed Down by Weak Smartphone Demand,2019-07-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc. gave a downbeat fourth-quarter sales forecast, indicating lingering weakness in smartphone demand while consumers wait for devices with the next generation of wireless technology.Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion, the San Diego-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That compares with an average of analystsâ estimates of $5.72 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The forecast projects a decline in sales of 12% to 26% from the period a year earlier.Phone makers have largely given up on releasing new high-end phones based on current technology and consumers are delaying their purchases until the debut of fifth generation, or 5G, cellular services, Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said. Thatâs making the near-term outlook for phones look âsoft,â but only temporarily ahead of an expected surge in demand for new devices, he said.âTheyâve all cut and run toward 5G,â Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. Carriers are heavily deploying new network equipment and the forthcoming phones are as slim and light as their 4G predecessors, he said, meaning the market will rapidly accelerate at the beginning of 2020.Qualcomm shares fell about 5% in extended trading after closing at $73.16 in New York. The stock has gained 29% this year, keeping pace with advances by other semiconductor-related shares.Net income rose to $2.1 billion, or $1.75 a share, in the fiscal third quarter, from $1.2 billion, or 81 cents, a year earlier. Earnings were boosted by a one-time payment from Apple to settle their dispute and the resumption of royalty payments. Excluding certain items, profit was 80 cents, compared with an average estimate of 76 cents. Adjusted revenue declined to $4.9 billion from $5.6 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had predicted $5.1 billion in sales.On a conference call, analysts questioned Qualcommâs confidence that the current periodâs shortfall will be reversed once the new networks are in place and the phones are on sale. The company has reduced its prediction for the total size of the market this year by 100 million units. Some analysts said they are concerned the numbers reflect little future growth for the industry regardless of what technology is in the phones.âThe marketâs saturated now. People buy phones when they break,â said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. âItâs bad all around. Itâs going to be a while.â âThe chipmaker is also still struggling to work through legal challenges that threaten its right to charge royalties on the technology for all phones used on modern networks, Qualcommâs main source of profit.Qualcommâs licensing customers are nonetheless continuing to pay licensing fees, Mollenkopf said. The chipmaker is still in dispute with Huawei Technologies Co. over the terms of a new agreement. The Chinese company had been making partial payments, but those will stop as they try to finalize a deal, he said.Huawei, which is not a major customer of Qualcommâs semiconductor unit, has been pushing heavily to boost its share of the market for smartphone chips in China, Mollenkopf said. Huaweiâs increasing presence has cost Qualcomm business among other Chinese device makers that are big users of Qualcommâs chips.While Qualcomm settled its broad-ranging legal dispute with Apple Inc. and the iPhone maker agreed to resume using its chips, the company lost a U.S. Federal Trade Commission case that alleged unfair business practices. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate patent licenses. Qualcomm is appealing the decision and seeking a stay on Kohâs decision so that it doesnât have to immediately start those renegotiations.Investors have been waiting to see Qualcomm, in its projected fifth year of revenue declines, parlay its claim of leadership in 5G wireless technology into sales growth. The new services are debuting this year with handsets from Samsung Electronics Co. that will take advantage of the faster downloads and response times offered by the upgraded networks. Most analysts expect wider availability next year.Qualcomm is unique in the chip industry because it gets the bulk its profit from licensing patents that it says cover the fundamentals of all modern phone systems. The majority of the companyâs revenue comes from selling chips that run phones and connect them to cellular networks.Growth in the smartphone market has stalled, leading some analysts to conclude that itâs reached a saturation point worldwide. In response, Qualcomm is trying to push wireless technology into new areas such as automobiles, personal computers and everyday devices that connect to the internet.Smartphone shipments declined 2.3% in the second quarter to 333.2 million units, IDC said Wednesday. While the market contraction hit all regions, the slowdown in China âwas less severe,â than it has been, the market researcher said.(Updates with comments from analyst in the seventh paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-30,208.78,213.04,4.26,0.020404253,Buy,4,46,821,54,6.577344701583435

1235,2320,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/even-boone-pickens-falling-love-135555775.html?.tsrc=rss,Even Boone Pickens Is Falling Out of Love With Oil,2019-07-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Venerable oil baron T. Boone Pickens is giving up on oil âÂ sort of. Less than 18 months ago, his fundÂ launched an ETF tracking stocks of companies expected to benefit from any increase in Brent crude oil prices. But soon, BOON âÂ the ticker of the NYSE Pickens Oil Response ETF âÂ will be no more. Instead, it will be relaunched as RENW, offering exposure to stocks benefiting from the transition to toward âa low-carbon economy.âBOONâs most obvious problem was that it hadnât really lived up to its ticker as far as investors are concerned. UnderperformingÂ the Brent oil price by about 7 percentage points since launch isnât catastrophic. Worse perhaps is the fact that the ETF didnât really partake in last fallâs oil rally (less than half its holdings are classified as âenergyâ companies). Still, that shielded it somewhat from the subsequent crash, unlike more heavily exposed E&P funds.Move past theÂ symbolism, and thereâs a simpler tale here.Not too long ago, the E&P sector had a shortage of oil and a trove of trust. Today, those positions are entirely reversed. Buoyed by the âpeak oilâ scare of the prior decade, investors funded a drilling spree, including in U.S. tight-oil basins. The result is a languid oil market barely able to rouse itself even when conflict threatens in the Persian Gulf. Return on that investment bled away to bad bets, cost-inflation and, all too often, fattened pay and perks in the c-suite. Meanwhile, Big Tech (among other sectors) competes successfully for investorsâ interest. Less than a decade ago, pundits speculated on the meaning of Apple Inc.âs market cap tentatively overtaking Exxon Mobil Corp.Â to be the biggest in the world. Now, it is just normal that Exxon isnât even in the top 10 (it is 13th right now).Despite oil prices more than doubling since the trough of early 2016, energyâs weight in the S&P 500 Index has actually slipped further, from more than 6% then to an all-time low of about 4.8% today.Looking at that relationship between energyâs weight and the oil price over the long term reveals a sobering trend for the industry. The chart below divides the annual real Brent oil price by energyâs weighting to provide a ratio that can be thought of like this: How many real dollars per barrel does it take to buy the sector one percentage point in the S&P 500?Before you begin drafting that email, this isnât intended to say thereâs a hard and fast relationship between where oil is trading and where the energy sectorâs weighting should settle. The direction of that line is undeniable, however.For most of the two decades leading up to 2000, the relationship was pretty stable, as oil prices fell in real terms from the spike of 1979, and the sectorâs relative value drifted down with it. That changed as the supercycle took hold after 1998. Oil equities rallied strongly âÂ the sector more than tripled by mid-2008 âÂ though not as much as the underlying commodity. That makes sense, as cyclical rallies, even daubed with the motto of âpeak oil,â arenât expected to last forever, and cost inflation within the business was becoming quite evident by 2006.The real oil price demanded to support the sectorâs place in the index has kicked into overdrive this decade. That is also partly a reflection of the underlying commodity, as rallies since 2014 have faded quickly amid excess supply.But itâs also due to that shortage of trust. Investors have been conditioned to expect energy firms to allocate any windfall from rising oil prices toÂ drilling budgets, M&A or executive pay, with precious little making its way back to shareholders. Also, unlike in the early 2000s, they now worry more about âpeak demandâ and climate change (hence, RENWâs imminent emergenceÂ from BOONâs chrysalis). So it takes a lot of dollars per barrel to persuade them there will be some left over for distributions.That is changing as some companies, particularly at the bigger end of the scale, have adopted strategies prioritizing payouts explicitly. The deficit is large, however. For example, ConocoPhillips has been the exemplar of putting returns over growthÂ in the past few years. However, its stock actually tradedÂ downÂ on Tuesday morning after reporting capital expenditure came in about $200 million above expectations in the second quarter âÂ despite twinning that with a $500 million bump to share buybacks.Yet Conocoâs playbook remains sensible. If energy stocks are proving unresponsive to oilÂ then, like Boone Pickens, itâs time for a radical change of approach.To contact the author of this story: Liam Denning at ldenning1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

(AAPL) like a hawk. While Q2 revenue dropped 5% year-over-year, the Street is predicting revenue growth to return this quarter. On July 29, five-star analyst, Timothy Arcuri, expressed his confidence in AAPLâs ability to rebound. The UBS analyst maintained his Buy rating while raising his price target from $225 to $235, suggesting 12% upside potential. Is this enough to convince investors that Apple is a Buy? Q3 Expectations According to consensus estimates, AAPL should return to revenue growth in Q3. However, the growth is only expected to be slight. Total revenue could reach $53.4 billion, an increase from $53.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. EPS is expected to be $2.10, down from the year-ago quarterâs $2.34.  Will iPhones Sales Recover?As iPhone sales make up half of its revenue, AAPL needs to narrow the 17% decline it reported in Q2 in order to meet the Streetâs expectations. The decrease was largely attributed to declining iPhone sales in China. The phone is also not cheap, with most iPhone users choosing not to upgrade until substantial changes are made. However, Apple is hoping to turn things around with its 5G iPhones that are on track to be released in 2020. After the company settled its legal dispute with Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) in April, it got access to QCOMâs modem chips that will allow AAPL to produce the 5G phones. On July 25, it was announced that AAPL will acquire the majority of Intel Corporationâs (INTC) smartphone modem business to eliminate its dependence on QCOMâs chips.Â  Arcuri remains unfazed by the iPhone sales decline. âEven if this year is subdued, it only sets up for a stronger 5G cycle in 2020 (at least two models). Apple has traded with the market in the recent weeks, but July/Aug are historically the best months to buy for three-month return,â he said. Another analyst, Samik Chatterjee, reiterated his Buy rating and $239 price target, suggesting 14% upside. âWe expect better earnings relative to consensus expectations, led by better revenue (consensus $53.3 bn) predicated on iPhone volume estimate of 37.5 mn units,â he said on July 29.  Does AAPLâs Product Diversification Make Up For Slow iPhone Sales?Some investors believe that Appleâs diverse product offerings will continue to drive growth in spite of slowed iPhone sales. In its second quarter, revenue from the wearables, home and accessories segment was up 30% year-over-year. Specifically, its AirPods, Apple Watch and Beats products sales jumped almost 50% year-over-year. CEO Tim Cook said, âThis business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch.âApple is also adding new services to its product pipeline including a TV streaming service, a credit card, a subscription based cloud gaming service and a news subscription service. Its news service was already released in March, while the others should all be launched by Fall 2019. Top financial blogger, Brad Moon, argues, âThe plateauing of the actual iPhone is forcing Apple to address a weakness that most anyone outside the analyst community didn't care much about while iPhone sales were going ga-ga: Apple is/was too reliant on a single product. Over the past few years, however, Apple has put more of its focus into improving its current products, widening its services and developing new technologies. Apple now has a stable of offerings that, when lumped together, may eventually boost revenues and profits past where they were at peak iPhone, all while insulating the company from weakness in any one division.â  Some Analyst Still Have DoubtsHowever, some analysts donât agree that Appleâs wearables and new services will add enough to earnings to make up for the pre-5G iPhone lull.Nomura analyst Jeff Kvaal says, âChina gaming recovery has not lifted App Store growth. Our Sensor Tower analysis indicates China gaming growth has recovered from the 2018 freeze on new game approvals, though gaming growth outside China has slowed. We believe App Store growth overall remains 15% to 18%; we model total Services growth similar to consensus of 16% to 17%.â On July 19, he reiterated his Hold rating and $180 price target, indicating 14% downside.  The Bottom LineThe Street is cautiously optimistic on AAPL. It has a âModerate Buyâ analyst consensus and an average price target of $216, suggesting 3% upside potential.",2019-07-30,208.78,213.04,4.26,0.020404253,Buy,21,69,742,111,14.959568733153638

Just witness Samsung Electronics Co.âsÂ bumbling attempt to bring out a foldable device.But as long as the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. keep this up, manufacturers of that âwow factorâÂ technology can make a pretty penny.Sony Corp. just posted operating income that beat estimates by around 30%, largely thanks to the division that makes 3D sensors for smartphone cameras.While the Japanese company is best known for itsÂ games, musicÂ and movies,Â itâs the imaging and sensors unit that outshone all others.Â Earnings for the business shot up 70% from a year earlier, the largest percentage increase for any of the companyâs divisions.Â Back in December, Sony executiveÂ Satoshi Yoshihara foreshadowed an increase in output of 3D sensors, a subset of the various image sensors that the company offers. Since then, Huawei has been reported to choose Sony imaging components for both its Honor 20 Pro and Mate P30 handsets.Â Apple also showed interest in the companyâs 3D sensors, according to Bloomberg News.Â This desperation to be fresh could be a welcome development for Sony. ItsÂ games division is looking weaker â the company just trimmed the unitâs full-year sales forecast âÂ so executives will be relying more heavily on smartphone makers.Â Apple and Huawei may be hoping that augmented reality and 3D give their devices just enough zing to convince folks to part with their money. For now, focusing on sensors could be Sonyâs sharpest strategy.Â To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Earn It After an initially rough year, Apple is growing again, and was up by 1% versus this time last year, with overall revenue sitting at $53.8 billion. Phone Home Apple is going out of its way to make sure investors know that Apple knows it has a bit of an iPhone problem. Sales for the iPhone have dropped off in recent years, as more and more consumers are content to hold onto their old phones rather than upgrade every time Apple drops a new model. To try to combat this cooling off, Apple began trade-in programs and offering financing for new iPhones. These efforts, analysts say, helped reduce the decline in iPhone sales to 11% from a 16% drop. Apple also plans to introduce three new iPhones this year, one with a triple-rear camera and two with double-rear cameras, though at more than a $1,000 each analysts arenât sure theyâll be hot sellers. Apple also remains bullish about its upcoming streaming television service. Private Parts Apple likes to boast about its reputation for privacy, especially as compared to Google or Facebook. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, declaring that âwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhoneâ. But now news has broken that, just like with Google Assistants, Apple has contractors listen to recordings captured by Siri. The contractors transcribe a small portion of Siriâs recordings to fine tune the device, but reportedly these recordings often feature sensetive information or couples having sex, because Siri was accidentally activated. -Michael Tedder Photo: REUTERS/SHANNON STAPLETON",2019-07-29,209.68,208.78,-0.9,-0.004292255,Don't move,14,11,293,39,13.310580204778159

Over 38 months, British sterling depreciated 16Â percent, the worst shrinkage for any similar period in 8Â years. The pound remains the poorest performer in the actively-traded foreign exchange market and inferior to the No. 3 euro.Europe's strongest major economy in the 21st century became a shadow of its former self, reversing two decades preceding the June 23, 2016 referendum when the U.K. outperformed the European Union in growth and investment. London's stock and bond markets similarly languished as laggards to world benchmarks, after beating them consistently in the 20 years prior to the decision to leave the EU, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.âIf I give myself some credit, I would say that we acted reasonably fast liquidating U.K. sharesâ in 2016, said Ben Rogoff, whose Polar Capital Technology Trust PLCÂ has been the most consistent winner out of the 212 British global funds with at least 1 billion pounds this year and during the past three years. His team's 114Â percent total return (income plus appreciation) was 22Â percentage points better than the Dow Jones World Technology Index, mostly because 68% of the fund is invested in the U.S., two-thirds of thatÂ in California companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. âIt's all about the Internet and where do you get exposed to the Internet? The U.S. and China,â Rogoff said last month during an interview at Bloomberg in London.While Rogoff reduced his holdings of three California tech powers during the past year âÂ Cupertino-based Apple Inc., Menlo Park-based Facebook and Santa Clara-based Advanced Micro Devices âÂ he acquired more shares in Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings Ltd., Hangzhou-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo-based Yahoo Japan Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The 46-year-old graduate of St. Catherine's College, Oxford, became the lead manager of the trust in 2006, âand at that time,â he said, âthe U.K. weighting might have been 5% to 10%, so if you had already been backing away to the door, it's a lot easier to escape than if you built a career around being an expert in U.K. equities.â Since the Brexit referendum, he said, âThere's just been a complete buyers' strike of U.K. equities.âProof of such disdain comes with the crisis this year at the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, Britain's most-prized investment when it was launched by star money manager Neil Woodford in 2014. The celebrated stock picker became even more prominent with his contrarian bullish stance on Brexit. The fund plummeted 31% during the past two years by holding a combination of large and small U.K. companies and has frozen redemptions indefinitely.âIt's symptomatic of a broader problem,â Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told reporters earlier this month. âOur sense is that the financial-stability risks are increasing.âOne U.K. investor whoâs successfully resisted the trend away from domestic stocks is Nick Train, who manages Finsbury Growth & Income Trust. It returned 61% the past three years â more than twice the FTSE All-Share Index benchmark âÂ as the most consistent one- and three-year performer among the 129 U.K.-based funds investing mostly in domestic stocks or bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Unlike Woodford, who doubled down on the British economy writ large, Train, a 60-year-old graduate of Queenâs College, Oxford, dramatically increased his holdings in consumer staples. These are the companies that make such essentials as food, beverages and household goods and can resist business cycles because their products always are in demand.Train, who declined to be interviewed, increased the consumer staples weighting relative to the benchmark to 27% from 23% in 2015 and he enhanced his holdings of Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez International Inc., which manufactures and markets packaged food products, and London-based Diageo PLC, the world's largest producer of spirits and beer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That's likely to be a safe bet as no one is counting on the British economy rebounding significantly from near the bottom of the EU while the uncertainty created by Brexit persists. âIf you take a long view, then this may well be a great time to be investing in U.K. equity,â said Rogoff. âThankfully, I don't have to make that binary call because there are very few U.K. companies I'm frankly interested in.â(Corrects location of Tencent Holdings headquarters in fifth paragraph of article published July 16.)&#92;--With assistance from Shin Pei, Richard Dunsford-White, Kateryna Hrynchak and Suzy Waite.To contact the author of this story: Matthew A.

Click to EnlargeThe bump looks like a heartbeat on an EKG, a spike of $3.50 per share that came after the Department of Justice uttered the magic words &quot;national security&quot; in defense of what Judge Lucy Koh and the Federal Trade Commission have called an illegal monopoly.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn a friend of the court brief filed with the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, Justice was joined by the Departments of Defense and Energy in arguing that Koh's decision threatens American leadership in a crucial sector of the global economy.The letter is unequivocal: &quot;Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, potentially undermining U.S. leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.&quot;  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Despite the letter, and a column from our own Bret Kenwell calling this &quot;the perfect opportunity to profit from Qualcomm stock,&quot; shares fell steadily after the spike. They opened July 19 at about $74.40, $1.30 per share lower than before the DoJ letter came out. Qualcomm Stock and International TroublesOne reason was a $272 million fine the European Union levied against Qualcomm. This was for blocking a British modem chip maker named Icera, later bought by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and closed, from the 3G baseband chip market a decade ago. Qualcomm calls the fine meritless.It's the second big EU fine in a year for Qualcomm, following a $1.1 billion levy over its treatment of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple settled its legal argument with the San Diego company in May, sending the shares from the mid-50s to the mid-80s within a few days.Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis placed the Justice letter against the EU fine and dropped his rating on Qualcomm.The merit in the Justice Department's argument is nationalistic, not legal. It is a political letter. Questionable Tactics and QualcommQualcomm's tactics of &quot;no license, no chips&quot; have given it monopoly power as mobile operators and others begin spending big on 5G networking gear. Even Apple was forced to back down, seeing that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was too far behind Qualcomm to deliver a competitive design in a timely manner.But Qualcomm does face a potential rival in China's Huawei, called a big winner after Koh's decision . When the Apple case was still alive, in January, Qualcomm had reached an interim patent licensing deal with Huawei.The Koh decision, based on facts Apple gave the Federal Trade Commission, led veteran analyst Rob Enderle to say Huawei will now win the race to 5G, predicting the company will pivot to its own, proprietary designs and come back stronger, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) did after its own antitrust fight.The argument is that Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch. The Bottom Line on Qualcomm stockKenwell's argument for Qualcomm stock is based on reading technical charts. Fundamentally he acknowledges the risk in Koh's decision and the European fines.But Qualcomm is now selling for less than four times its annual sales. Its dividend of 62 cents per share, well supported by earnings, represents a yield of 3.33%. That's better than what you get on a 30-year bond. This at a time when Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is selling for over 15 times sales, without a dividend.If Qualcomm loses and must adjust its business practices, it's still going to win a big share of the 5G modem marketplace. If it wins, and the U.S. has now put its thumb on that scale, the stock is cheap.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

1277,2494,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-netflix-stock-looks-good-103220825.html?.tsrc=rss,Weakness in Netflix Stock Looks Like a Good Buying Opportunity,2019-07-22,"Many analysts and pundits are saying that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is in trouble, pointing to looming competition from Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the net decline of the company's U.S. subscriber count in the second quarter. But that pullback by NFLX stock in the wake of those has created a very good buying opportunity for long-term investors.Source: Shutterstock There's been a vigorous debate among analysts and pundits about whether and to what extent rivals' new internet video offerings will hurt NFLX stock. I think the stepped-up competition will provide Netflix's results and NFLX stock with a tremendous boost. Heated Competition Looks Like Blessing in DisguiseTo be sure, the reams of hype likely to accompany the rollouts of Disney+ and Apple TV+ will spur even more cord-cutting across America. The publicity will make more viewers aware of the tremendous volume of shows and movies that are now available online, causing a further exodus from cable and satellite services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAn April report by Convergence Research Group predicted that, by the end of this year, 34% of U.S. households would &quot;cut the cord,&quot; that is, give up their cable or satellite subscription.But by providing more content and working hard to publicize their services, Disney and Apple will accelerate that trend in 2020.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown Consequently, many more Americans will realize that they can save money -- and still get access to more than enough content -- by cutting the cord.As a result, from 34% at the end of 2019, the percentage of Americans with internet video services will, I believe, roughly double to 68% by the end of 2020.In 2018, there were about 128 million households in the U.S. Rounding that up to 130 million (to account for the passage of roughly two years) and multiplying by 68% yields 88.4 million homes.If NFLX, as the first mover in internet video, can get 90% of those households, it will have 80 million subscribers. Knocking of 10% to account for password-sharing between households leaves us at 72 million. That's well short of Netflix's 90 million U.S. subscriber goal, but it's nearly 20% above the company's slightly more than 60 million subscribers as of the end of Q2.A nearly 20% gain in 18 months should please and pleasantly surprise the owners of Netflix stock while hurting the credibility of bears on NFLX stock who argue that the company has reached a saturation point in the U.S. Assessing Rivals ThreatCan Netflix really boost its subscriber base in the face of new competition?The answer is &quot;definitely&quot; and for a couple of reasons. First, I'd argue that the services from Disney and Apple probably won't really have the same attributes as Netflix. Disney's entertainment service, Disney+, will likely consist primarily of movies and TV shows geared to children and/or fans of action shows. Apple's service looks likely to consist primarily of reruns and movies, with only a few original shows. So Netflix will remain the only highly popular streaming option with a great deal of original content meant to appeal to mainstream adult audiences.Second, the price points of the streaming video services should allow a majority of Americans to afford more than one streaming service. Disney+ will only cost $6.99 per month. AAPL hasn't announced the price of Apple TV+, but it's expected to be well below the $13 cost of a standard Netflix plan.Most Americans are used to paying around $80 at least per month for TV content. So shelling out $20 or $30 per month for multiple streaming services isn't going to give most people sticker shock. Moreover, most of the consumers with the highest disposable income still have cable. As many more higher income Americans cut the cord, they'll definitely be able to afford three or more internet video subscriptions. Real Prize for NFLX StockAs is often the case, many analysts and pundits are getting caught up in the trees instead of focusing on the forest.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now They're focusing on the 126,000 net U.S. subscribers Netflix lost last quarter while ignoring the company's real opportunity to become the first truly worldwide TV service. They made a similar mistakes last year with Snap (NYSE:SNAP), as they focused on the company's small subscriber losses and ignored its huge ad revenue opportunity.Let's say that, in five years, Netflix becomes about twice as popular as Apple worldwide. That's not an unrealistic goal, since Apple's market share in many countries is actually quite low.In 2016, Credit Suisse estimated that there were nearly 600 million Apple users worldwide. If 1.2 billion adults live in households that subscribe to Netflix, and 600 million households pay an average of $10 per month for the service, its revenue would be $72 billion per year.   If its profit comes in at $10 billion, its earnings per share would be $23. A price/earnings ratio of 25 would put Netflix stock's price per share at around $525, versus today's $325. And that doesn't account for likely price increases by 2025 or other forms of revenue that could eventually kick in, like advertising, theme parks, and premium services. Bottom Line on Netflix StockIncreased competition could actually boost Netflix stock by enticing many more Americans to cut the cord. Meanwhile, NFLX stock could increase around 80% over the next five years if the company continues to sign up subscribers around the world. Although NFLX will have to execute well to accomplish that goal, given the company's huge success so far, long-term,speculative investors should make that bet.As of this writing, the author did not own shares of any stocks mentioned.

1283,2500,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-tight-lipped-culture-makes-010805473.html?.tsrc=rss,Netflixâs Tight-Lipped Culture Makes Surprises Hard to Avoid,2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc.âs biggest earnings surprise in years sent the shares plummeting the day after results were released, leaving analysts and investors wondering why they were caught so off guard.When some companies know that their quarterly results are going to fall short of forecasts, they put out a pre-announcement or update their guidance. But not Netflix.Instead, the company dropped a bombshell with no warning: Its customer growth was roughly half what it projected, and Netflix actually lost U.S. subscribers during the period. That hasnât happened since 2011, when the company made a disastrous attempt to split up its streaming and DVD-by-mail operations.The fallout on Thursday included the worst stock rout in three years, with the stock declining 10% to erase more than $16 billion in market value. Shares in Netflix extended those declines on Friday, falling 3.1% to $315.10 per share, their lowest since January. The stock has fallen for seven consecutive sessions, the longest losing streak in nearly four years.âYou would think Netflix would want to update guidance or give a pre-annoucement, as Iâm sure they definitely knew about this for a while,â said Nick Licouris, an investment adviser at Gerber Kawasaki. âBut they probably didnât want to do it because they were going to take a hit at that time or during earnings -- especially since subscriber numbers are the No. 1 thing analysts look at -- and in earnings you can spin it better than a stand-alone announcement.âNot Necessary?Another reason not to issue a warning: The company met most of Wall Streetâs financial estimates, such as sales and profit. It was only the subscriber numbers that really came up short.âRevenue was very close to guidance and profits were actually above, so Iâd guess they didnât think it was necessary to pre-announce a weak sub number when other financial metrics were fine,â said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.Thereâs also been a broader shift away from giving earnings warnings, said Huber Research Partners founder Craig Huber.âI have noticed companies in media and internet that I follow do not seem to pre-announce pending negative results with the same regularity as years ago,â he said.Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, didnât have an immediate comment.The streaming giantâs tight-lipped culture extends beyond earnings. Unlike traditional media companies, itâs very selective about the viewer information it provides. Third parties try to fill the gaps by providing their own data on Netflixâs audience, but that can prove to be unreliable.Third-Party ServicesThose kinds of data services failed to predict the latest shortfall, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker said in a note.âFor several days,â she said, âinvestors told us âsuch-and-such data service suggests domestic adds will come in line; while international might be somewhat soft.â Wrong. I mean -- right in the sense that international was soft but totally wrong on the domestic subs part.âNetflix remains the dominant paid video streaming service, with its sights set on international expansion to counter slowing growth at home. But rising competition abroad -- such as a U.K. streaming venture announced Friday between ITV Plc and the BBC -- could challenge that growth as well.Netflix also delivers its earnings in an idiosyncratic way. Instead of doing a traditional Q&A conference call, the company releases an âearnings interviewâ on YouTube with a single analyst. It also issues its reports on its website, not through the paid services that many companies use to disseminate information.Though this weekâs stock rout was especially severe, itâs common for Netflixâs earnings to spark a huge share move. The average change on the day after quarterly reports is almost 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Compare that with Apple Inc., where itâs 4.4%. Or Microsoft Corp., where itâs 4.1%.Thereâs another explanation for the huge swings in Netflixâs stock: overreaction. That was the message from Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings this week. Itâs easy to âoverinterpretâ subscriber figures, he said.âSometimes we are forecast high, sometimes we forecast low,â he said. âWeâre just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can.â(Closes shares in fourth paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Morwenna Coniam.To contact the reporters on this story: Kamaron Leach in New York at kleach6@bloomberg.net;Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob GolumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-18,205.66,202.59,-3.07,-0.01492755,Don't move,2,48,722,52,7.202216066481995

After losing over one-fourth of its value during the spring, Square stock has now recovered to its February highs.Source: Shutterstock This leaves traders wondering where SQ goes next. The increasing influence of Square could eventually make the company one of the biggest in tech. Consequently, this growth has taken the company to high valuations.While this portends well for the future of the company, whether to buy SQ stock at these levels remains unclear.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now  Square Is the Next Tech GiantSquare is so much more than a competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Long term, SQ stock will become the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of finance. It has begun to follow in Amazon's footsteps by becoming both a conglomerate and an ecosystem, and ultimately, a disruptor.The company started by enabling every smartphone owner to accept credit cards. It has since moved into point-of-sale systems and can now handle other business functions such as payroll, funding, and marketing. It has also enabled website creation through its purchase of Weebly. Late last year, Square even made a second attempt to become a bank. This approval would allow them to accept deposits.All this will combine into the same ecosystem, one that could do to many industries what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) did to video stores and cable television. If nothing else, it makes Square's point-of-sale system a more compelling offering than the ones built by a company such as NCR (NYSE:NCR).The increasingly cashless society also plays into the firm's plans well. Square's Cash App serves the same function as banks from a consumer standpoint. This could leave investors and consumers may question the future need for a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or a Citigroup (NYSE:C). While I believe it is too early to predict the destruction of large banks, it could force radical changes to their business models to survive.Consequently, the question as to whether to buy SQ stock has become one of when and not if to buy. Like other disruptors, SQ trades at a high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Analysts forecast average annual profit growth at 46.1% for the foreseeable future. Hence, the company can attract investors even with its forward PE of around 73. The Charts on Square StockWithout fundamentals, analysts will evaluate Square based on charts and momentum. SQ happens to trade at a critical level. At around $82 per share, Square stock trades almost 20% below its all-time high of $101.15 per share. It has also reached the approximate price point from which it pulled back in February.If it sustains itself above $82 per share, I think it will run higher in the near term, perhaps even retesting levels above $100 per share. A pullback could mean that it retests support in the mid-$70s per share range.It could also portend the beginning of a trading range between the low $60s and low $80s per share level.Another critical point could come Aug.1 when the San Francisco-based financial tech firm reports earnings for the second quarter. Since SQ will likely report an earnings beat, investors should watch forward guidance. This could provide the catalyst needed to drive Square stock for the foreseeable future. The Bottom Line on Square StockInvestors need more clarity on the equity's direction before buying SQ stock. Square supports a massive growth rate and continues to make the moves that could make its ecosystem one of the most influential in all of tech.However, the price of Square stock has reached levels where it pulled back in February. At this point, investors need to know that SQ is not forming a double top in the low $80s per share range.If it closes in the mid-$80s per share range or higher, it could retest that $101.15 per share high. If it pulls back, investors should wait until the stock finds its next inflection point.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The EU said Thursdayâs fine was 1.27% of Qualcommâs revenue last year and &quot;aimed at deterring market players&quot; from trying the same thing.The Qualcomm investigation targeted 3G chips for internet mobile dongles sold between 2009 and 2011. Regulators said these were sold below cost to Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., &quot;two strategically important customers,&quot; in order to push Icera, now owned by Nvidia Corp., out of the market.&quot;Icera was becoming a viable supplier of UMTS chipsets providing high data rate performance, thus posing a growing threat to Qualcommâs chipset business,&quot; the EU said.Companies have complained about the slow pace of EU antitrust enforcement in fast-moving technology markets. Icera sought to draw in the EU by filing a complaint in 2010. It was sold to Nvidia a year later in 2011. The EU opened an investigation four years after that.Qualcomm said in a statement it will appeal and âexpose the meritless nature of this decision.â It said it plans to provide a financial guarantee instead of paying the fine, until the courts have ruled.âThe commissionâs decision is based on a novel theory of alleged below-cost pricing over a very short time period and for a very small volume of chips,â Qualcommâs general counsel Don Rosenberg said in the statement. âContrary to the commissionâs findings, Qualcommâs alleged conduct did not cause anti-competitive harm to Icera.âNvidia didnât immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple ChipsLast year Qualcomm was handed the EUâs fifth-largest antitrust penalty over payments to Apple that the EU said were an illegal ploy to ensure only its chips were used in iPhones and iPads. San Diego-based Qualcomm is challenging the fine at the EU courts.Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is unique among semiconductor makers in that it gets most of its profit from licensing patents. Makers of handsets pay the company royalties, whether or not they use its chips.

The Taiwanese company earlier reported a fall in June-quarter net income to NT$66.8 billion ($2.1 billion), surpassing the NT$65.7 billion estimated.TSMCâs solid outlook may allay fears of a persistent global chip downturn as Washington and Beijing clash. Its technological edge in chipmaking may help it grab an outsized portion of demand for advanced high-performance semiconductors, particularly as countries roll out ultra-fast fifth generation wireless networks. TSMCâs business has bottomed and should begin to rebound, Chief Executive Officer C. C.

It previously reported a 4.5% slide in first-half revenue -- its worst January-to-June performance since 2011.While top executives expressed confidence that things are turning around, they warned of uncertainty springing from global trade tensions. Japanâs curbs on the export to South Korea of certain vital chipmaking materials could hammer industry players like Samsung Electronics Co., and further depress global smartphone demand.âThe recent Japan-Korea dispute is probably the most uncertainâ factor for TSMCâs fourth quarter, Chairman Mark Liu said.As the worldâs largest player in the business of made-to-order chips, TSMC is a barometer for the broader industry as well as Apple, which accounts for about a fifth of its revenue. While uncertainty remains, its better-than-projected outlook underscores expectations the industry is bottoming out after a dismal few years, when consumers took longer to replace their smartphones and Bitcoin prices collapsed.The company on Thursday signaled its intention to invest for the future, saying its spending on capacity and upgrades could exceed $11 billion this year.TSMCâs shares stood largely unchanged before the announcement and have gained more than 12% this year.(Updates with commentary around Japan and Korea from the 7th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Gao Yuan, Sheryl Tian Tong Lee and Adela Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-18,205.66,202.59,-3.07,-0.01492755,Don't move,4,30,539,38,7.050092764378478

At stake is the stockâs $35 billion rebound in market value since a January low.Apple Inc.âs ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. are seen by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts to lift sales, which would also be boosted if President Donald Trump loosens trade restrictions on key customer Huawei Technologies Co.TSMCâs Sales May Swing Back to Growth on Huawei Orders: ReactAnalysts have forecast sales in the period to grow 15% from a quarter earlier, according to the average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The companyâs shares are up 12% this year, despite being whipsawed as the trade war escalated. They edged 0.6% higher Thursday morning.âThe companyâs second-half outlook looks to be improving, and third-quarter guidance will probably be strong given that some of the lingering uncertainty has started to fade,â said John Tsai, portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments Ltd. in Singapore. The trade spat between Japan and South Korea may also help TSMC, as Samsung Electronics Co. customers such as Qualcomm Inc. may seek to diversify, he added.TSMC saw sales drop 4.5% year-on-year in the first half, its worst performance since 2011. The company was grappling with the impact of a slowing global smartphone market and efforts by its biggest customer Apple to move beyond hardware. Then the trade war escalated into the U.S. blacklisting Huawei, TSMCâs second-largest customer.Yet its leading position in advanced technology, especially in 5G and artificial intelligence, helped it secure revenue. Chip orders for crypto mining are also expected to help TSMCâs third-quarter sales, according to Morgan Stanley, which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%.TSMC investors will also receive a NT$207 billion ($6.7 billion) dividend payout Thursday, according to stock exchange and company statements. The company is aiming for a dividend per share of at least NT$10 to lure value investors, something Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Robin Cheng and Mike Yang see as possible in 2020. They argue that rising free cash flow justifies a re-rating of the stock.Here are some highlights of 3Q 2019 estimates:Gross margin: 48.3% (19 estimates)Revenue: NT$276.6b (22 estimates)Net income (GAAP): NT$96.04b (20 estimates)Operating profit: NT$103.5b (15 estimates)Timing: release after market July 18(Updates prices.)To contact the reporters on this story: Cindy Wang in Taipei at hwang61@bloomberg.net;Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sofia Horta e Costa at shortaecosta@bloomberg.net, David Watkins, Philip GlamannFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-18,205.66,202.59,-3.07,-0.01492755,Don't move,3,40,473,46,9.725158562367865

Shares of the streaming media giant plunged nearly 11% on volume that was more than quadruple the daily average. This after the company said it added just 2.83 million subscribers in the second quarter, well below expectations of 4.8 million.Source: Shutterstock Netflix investors are fretting that Dow component Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will pilfer market share from Netflix as that company ramps up its own stream offerings. Interestingly, shares of Disney fell 0.67% today.Even with those trouble spots, the Nasdaq Composite, of which Netflix is a member, gained 0.27% while the S&P 500 added 0.36%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Before getting into what happened today, I'll take this opportunity to remind readers that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports after the bell Thursday. The Dow component, up 0.11% today, is expected to post adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 on revenue of $32.8 billion. Microsoft's report will go a long way in determining the fate of markets on Friday. Big Blue: IBM SurgesShares of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) surged 4.59% on more than triple the daily average after the Dow component posted second-quarter net income of $2.5 billion, or $2.81 a share, up from $2.4 billion, or $2.61 a share, last year. Revenue fell to $19.16 billion from $20 billion. Analysts expected IBM to earn $3.08 a share on revenue of $19.17 billion.While revenue dipped and missed expectations, IBM was able to rally thanks to its cloud computing revenue. Revenue for the quarter was $5.65 billion, beating analysts' expectations calling for $5.55 billion.IBM said it still expects to earn at least $13.90 per share this year. Charge ThisShares of American Express (NYSE:AXP) gained 1.03%, good for the second-best performance in the Dow after IBM. The credit card giant ascended to another record high ahead of its earnings report, due out Friday before the opening bell.The company is expected to report second-quarter earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $2.94 billion. Shares of American Express are up nearly 36% year-to-date, making the stock one of the Dow's best performers and one of the best-performing names among large-cap financial services names.With that came some unusual put buying in stock today, indicating some traders are bracing for a post-earnings decline or, at the very least, are hedging long stock positions in AXP. Dialing Up 5GApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 1.14% on some encouraging analyst chatter regarding the company's position in the 5G race.&quot;Apple's near-term iPhone problem is mix,&quot; said Raymond James analyst Chris Caso in a note. &quot;Apple is selling a much larger mix of legacy iPhones than in the past. The reason, in our view, is twofold: higher prices for flagship phones, coupled with the fact that there's virtually nothing a user can do with an iPhone XS that they can't do with a 6s â¦ think the higher bandwidth and improved connectivity of 5G will provide a more compelling upgrade.&quot;Caso upgraded Apple to &quot;outperform&quot; with a $250 price target. Dow Jones Bottom LineWith market participants focusing on earnings, at least for now, some are wondering what the fate of a Federal Reserve rate cut will be. Between better-than-expected earnings and some strong economic data, the Fed may not feel the need to cut borrowing costs this month or anytime soon.On Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its regional manufacturing survey registered at 21.8 in June, the best reading this year, and well above estimates calling for a reading of 5. The Fed is, in its own words, data dependent, and the better the data, the less likely a rate cut becomes.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

Square stock shot from $60 to $82. But hey, so has the rest of the market. Just some of the catalysts include the expectation of lower interest rates and a truce with the U.S.-China trade war.Source: Shutterstock And yes, some Wall Street analysts are warming up to Square stock. Consider Raymond James' John Davis, who raised his rating on the shares from underperform to market perform. The main reason for this is he believes that Square's debit card is likely to see increased momentum, adding as much as $100 million to the top-line next year.No doubt, this would be a big deal.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut of course, much of the focus for SQ stock will be on the near-term. In fact, we'll get the second-quarter results on Aug. 1.So what is on tap?  Well, in terms of revenues, the consensus forecast is calling for $557 million, up about 45% on a year-over-year basis. As for the bottom line, the estimate is 16 cents a share, compared to 13 cents during the same period last year.  All in all, there remains quite a bit of optimism on Wall Street.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip  The Square Stock Price and Other NewsDuring the quarter, there has been much activity, especially with partnerships. Here's a look at some of the notable events:  * Square teamed up with the Ogden Raptors - a minor league baseball team that's part of the Los Angeles Dodgers farm system - to provide payment services. The deal involves both online sources, such as with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and offline ones.  * Called Square for Restaurants, this is a set of order management integrations for Postmates, DoorDash and Chowly. All these services are not part of the core POS system, which means eliminating the use of various other tablets and manual entry of orders.  * Square has entered a deal to be the payments and POS provider for the Indianapolis 500. The event includes more than 300,000 customers and about 500 concession stands. It's actually the largest sports venue in the world.  * A resident of southern California has sued Square because he alleges the company's invoice system mistakenly sent his personal medical history to a friend. His attorneys are looking to put together a class-action suit. Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal recently wrote a piece on how Square's system has misfired on various occasions.  * Now when it comes to SQ stock, one of the most important growth drivers is its Cash App. According to Instinet analysts Dan Dolev and Conan Leon, the app has 56.1 million users, which is more than PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) fast-growing Venmo. They currently have a $100 price target on SQ stock, which was recently increased from $90. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare CEO Jack Dorsey has certainly done a great job with the company. What started as a simple app has quickly transformed into a strong platform with a robust ecosystem. It's also amazing that he has been able to do this while still the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Yet there are definitely issues with SQ stock. Even though the company deserves a premium valuation, it is still quite steep, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 73X.Sell-side analysts are generally cautious as well, with three sell ratings and 17 holds. And the average price target assumes zero upside from current levels.For the most part, Square stock is pricing in much of the good news. So this could make the upcoming earnings report a bit dicey since the growth rate has already been trending down during the past few quarters.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

And one of the first notable companies to report its earnings is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).  It is slated to announce its second-quarter results  on Wednesday, July 17 after the market closes.Like the shares of many other tech companies, Ebay stock has been on fire. In 2019, eBay stock price has surged an impressive 43%. That is actually better than arch rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has gained about 34%.Yet until this year Ebay stock had been a laggard. For the past five years, eBay stock price has risen by an average of only 9.2%, versus the average 44% gain of AMZN stock over the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what can we expect from eBay earnings? For the top line, analysts, on average, are calling for an increase of 2.6%, while their consensus earnings per share estimate is 62 cents per share, up from 53 cents in the same period last year.  * 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week But Ebay earnings may actually get overshadowed next week because on July 15 and  July 16 Amazon.com will hold its mega sale, Prime Day.  That will definitely suck up a lot of the attention of business-news media outlets and of investors.Yet eBay will not sit idly by. The company has announced its &quot;Crash Sale&quot; program, which, according to eBay, is being held on July 15 in case Amazon's website crashes, as it did during  last year's Prime Day. To this end, eBay has put together a new website called &quot;The Brand Outlet,&quot; which has plenty of items from top brands like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, KitchenAid and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) with discounts of as much as 70%.According to eBay's VP and COO of the Americas, Jay Hanson: &quot;eBay is primed to deliver exactly what shoppers want during this year's crash (sale). July has become a massive shopping season, and our summer sales include blockbuster deals that will not disappoint.&quot;The company has made other moves that have helped to boost Ebay stock.  Here's a look at some of them:  * Over the past year or so, eBay has been transforming its marketplaces to improve users' experience. While the transition has been choppy, the long-term results should be positive.  Keep in mind that buyers have indicated that the new system is better and will encourage them to buy more products on eBay.  * eBay has launched a digital- ad business, enabling it to more effectively monetize its users.  * In early March, eBay launched a strategic review. This was the result of  pressure from activist investors Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value LP, which have both taken large stakes in eBay stock.  The firms now  have two seats on eBay's board between them. As part of the review, eBay will also explore other potential moves, including selling assets, such as the StubHub website and eBay Classifieds Group.  * eBay has announced that it plans to return $7 billion in capital back to the owners of eBay during the next two years. Given Ebay stock has a market cap of $34.6 billion, $7 billion is a sizable amount of money. The Bottom Line on eBay Stock PriceEven after the rally of Ebay stock, its valuation is still reasonable, as its forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average estimate,  is 13. By comparison, the forward PE ratios of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  and AAPL are 22 and 16, respectively.Granted, Ebay stock is still facing major risks. Its growth is uninspiring, as its gross merchandise volume fell 4% in Q1. And analysts don't think GMV rebounded  much in Q2. eBay also continues to have difficulties making inroads against Amazon.com.But the good news is that the company appears to be serious about getting things on track and is focused on increasing the value of Ebay stock, as seen by its responses to the requests of Elliott Management Corp. and Starboard Value. And besides, expectations for eBay's Q2 results are muted - and should be beatable.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

1342,2646,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtubes-trampled-foes-plot-antitrust-100000772.html?.tsrc=rss,YouTube's Trampled Foes Plot Antitrust Revenge,2019-07-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Brian OâKelley built AppNexus Inc. to help companies advertise anywhere on the internet. Its software plugged into virtually every digital ad-trading hub, including those from Google, the biggest ad seller, and Googleâs YouTube video service. By 2014, AppNexus was valued at $1.2 billion.Then, in 2015, Google stopped letting companies buy ads on YouTube using outside software. The move got more marketers to use Google ad services. It also created a glaring hole for AppNexus: The startup could no longer give customers access to the largest supply of online video. It never really recovered.âThey crushed our growth and ruined our product,&quot; said OâKelley, who stepped down as AppNexus chief executive officer last year. YouTube represented a huge portion of the video inventory that AppNexus offered to advertisers. Those marketers couldnât just ignore YouTube &quot;because itâs pretty much a monopoly in that space,&quot; he added. &quot;Itâs not a supply-and-demand problem. Itâs a âYou just broke our entire businessâ problem.ââThe story is familiar to advertising and media entrepreneurs who built businesses around YouTube, only to be hobbled when the video giant changed the rules of engagement. Google used YouTubeâs popularity to lure creators, media companies and tech firms onto the service, gaining access to more videos and ad space. YouTube then used that supply to control ad prices and amass data about viewers, squeezing out anyone that tried to compete, according to interviews with more than a dozen partners, rivals and former employees. Many asked not to be identified discussing sensitive information about a powerful industry player.YouTube didnât wipe out competition in one fell swoop, or act maliciously, according to these people. Instead, YouTube made decisions to consolidate the video ad-buying process, with little regard for partners or competition, and few regulatory checks. That left a graveyard of failed companies in its wake and fewer choices for advertisers, the people said.In digital video advertising, YouTube has no peers. The U.S. market harnessed $16.3 billion in ad spending last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. YouTube accounted for the majority of that. Globally, the video giant generated $16 billion in 2018 sales, BMO Capital Markets estimates.YouTube disputes this depiction of its dominance. The company said it shares more than half its ad sales with video producers, and competes in a much bigger market than just online video ads. &quot;Viewers have never had more choice when it comes to where to watch their favorite videos,&quot; YouTube spokeswoman Andrea Faville wrote in an email. &quot;Similarly, advertisers have a wide and growing array of options, including traditional television, which still accounts for the majority of video ad spend.&quot;But U.S. regulators and politicians are now listening to claims that Google and YouTube may have run afoul of the law. The Department of Justice is considering an antitrust investigation of Google. The Federal Trade Commission is probing allegations that YouTube violated privacy laws protecting children, Bloomberg reported earlier this year. Congress, which has multiple investigations into Google and its peers, recently requested an interview with a former YouTube business partner, according to some of the people who spoke with Bloomberg.âIf youâre looking into Google, it would be remiss not to look at YouTube,â said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy for Open Markets Institute, a think tank. âYouâve got monopolies upon monopolies.âYouTube may be preparing for scrutiny. Its executives recently reached out to partners to ask how its practices have affected their ad sales, according to one of the people who spoke with Bloomberg. YouTube did so as part of typical partner relationship management efforts, but this person interpreted the outreach as a sign of YouTube nerves about antitrust regulation.Vevo humbledFew companies show YouTubeâs grip on the digital video market better than Vevo, which distributes music videos online from two of the three largest record labels.The company was conceived by Doug Morris, then head of Universal Music Group. Founded in 2009, Vevo collected music videos and original programming, and distributed those clips across the internet â on YouTube, on Yahoo and on Vevo.com. The ultimate goal was to turn Vevoâs site into the MTV of the internet and get higher advertising rates, Morris said.At a lunch with Morris, then Google CEO Eric Schmidt embraced the idea. Vevo could share ad revenue with the internet giant when Vevo clips ran on YouTube.As YouTube grew, though, the relationship frayed. Vevo music videos were popular on YouTube, and advertisers loved them. But YouTube couldnât sell ads on these clips because Vevo had exclusive rights in every market where it operated. The Google unit set out to take control of this valuable inventory through aggressive contract negotiations, sneaky sales tactics and even an effort to buy its rival outright, according to the people who spoke with Bloomberg.In late 2012, YouTube proposed a new contract that would have allowed it to also sell ads on Vevo videos, and would have reduced Vevoâs share of the revenue from those ads. Google also offered to buy Vevo. When the record labels balked, YouTube said it would take down Vevo music videos before the existing contract expired, according to the people who spoke with Bloomberg.Vevoâs leadership called an emergency board meeting. The company stood to lose millions of dollars if it disappeared from YouTube, which then reached about 1 billion people a month and accounted for most of Vevoâs audience and sales.Vevo executives told YouTube they would file an injunction describing what they said was bullying tactics, and asking a judge to block the video giant from removing Vevo videos, according to former employees and music industry executives. The gambit worked. YouTube agreed to a new deal that let Vevo keep exclusive rights to its ad inventory.In July 2013, Google acquired a minority stake in Vevo. That didnât give it full control, but offered more visibility into Vevoâs business.YouTubeâs attempts to stifle Vevo continued, according to people familiar with the efforts. While it couldnât access Vevoâs ad inventory, the video giant could reduce its influence, the people said.YouTube encouraged artists to go around Vevo by creating their own YouTube channels to replace the ones operated by Vevo, the people said. Faville, the YouTube spokeswoman, said the company encouraged artists to consolidate their presence on a single &quot;official&quot; channel to avoid confusion. &quot;This product change was a net benefit to fans and artists,&quot; she added.YouTube also flirted with the limits of its Vevo deal. Some of YouTubeâs sales pitches to advertisers included the Vevo logo and artists such as Rihanna, according to people who saw the documents. The documents suggested that YouTube could run ads on Vevo videos even though YouTube was contractually prohibited from doing so. Vevo executives flagged the problem to YouTube executives, who apologized and blamed the sales team, the people said. Faville called this a one-time error.Vevo tried to send viewers to its own website and mobile app, but YouTubeâs algorithms made that risky. The software recommended videos that were watched a lot on YouTube. If Vevo clips were seen elsewhere, those views were not counted by the Google unit. The result: Vevo videos didnât perform as well on YouTube, according to industry executives. Faville said YouTubeâs algorithms donât factor whether videos direct viewers elsewhere.In 2018, Vevo stopped competing with YouTube for a large consumer audience, shutting its app and website, and cutting product and engineering staff. Around the same time, YouTube secured a deal that gave it what rivals say it wanted all along: the right to sell Vevoâs ads.In thinking about what went wrong, Morris remembers discussing Vevo with Steve Jobs. âWhy wonât Vevo be worth billions?â he asked before the Apple Inc. co-founder died in 2011. Jobs said Google already effectively owned Vevo because YouTube had a lock on Vevoâs viewers. &quot;Theyâll control it,&quot; Jobs warned, according to Morris.Once envisioned as a site that would compete with YouTube for views and ad dollars, Vevo is now mostly a logo with a small sales team.Machinimaâs demiseMachinima Inc., like Vevo, started out as an asset for YouTube. In YouTubeâs early days, it didnât have an advertising sales team nor staff managing relationships with individual video creators. Machinima was one of the first companies to assemble a network of YouTube channels and creators. It sold ads on the channelsâ behalf, struck deals with brands and developed YouTube stars, including PewDiePie, one of the most popular video bloggers. That success spawned clones, including Maker Studios, Fullscreen and AwesomenessTV. Known as multi-channel networks, or MCNs, they were seen as the cable networks of the future.But the relationship soured as MCNs got big enough to compete for ad dollars. YouTube executives didnât want third parties getting in between viewers, video creators and advertisers, according to former MCN executives and employees. So YouTube made MCNs superfluous by replicating many of their offerings, while limiting their access to data and tools that would have helped them build their own businesses, these people said.In November 2013, YouTube instituted a policy that made it clear MCNs would need to look beyond YouTube if they wanted to thrive. The company said it would take 45% of ad sales from all partners on YouTube, up from the 30% it collected from some large media companies. Solo creators could survive on a 55% share, but the MCNs couldnât support their growing staff and expansion plans.âThese companies realized advertising sales werenât enough,â said Peter Csathy, founder of advisory firm CREATV Media. âToo much of a share had to go to YouTube.â YouTubeâs Faville said revenue sharing agreements with MCNs didnât change.The MCNs tried using collective power to get more favorable terms. They wrote a letter asking YouTube to consider changes, but that went nowhere. Some MCN executives pitched their boards on going to the Justice Department to file an antitrust suit against YouTube, but directors refused to fund what would have been a long and expensive legal battle, according to people familiar with the deliberations.Relations between MCNs and YouTube deteriorated under Susan Wojcicki, who took over as chief executive officer of YouTube in 2014. The veteran Google advertising leader corralled the companyâs huge digital sales force to focus more on YouTube. She also created Google Preferred, a package of the best-performing videos on YouTube that advertisers could buy.YouTube already sold more video ad space at attractive prices than any media company online. With Google Preferred, YouTube could also compete on quality. Google offered advertisers similar videos as Machinima at lower prices, with better targeting and more volume. YouTube had the relevant clips â and, with data from Googleâs other popular services, it knew more about what viewers wanted to see. Smaller media companies like Machinima could not sustain their sales forces selling less-targeted ads at the lower rates offered by Google and YouTube.One by one, the MCNs either shrank, sold themselves or died. Earlier this year, Machinima laid off its remaining employees and ceased operations.AppNexusâs ordealBrian OâKelleyâs AppNexus had a similar experience. It flourished in a market that Google helped create: programmatic online advertising. For years, ads were placed with handshake deals between marketers willing to spend and websites willing to sell. With programmatic software, buying ads became more automated, effective, cheaper and faster. Several firms raised millions of dollars to pursue this opportunity. Rocket Fuel Inc., went public in 2013 valued at more than $2 billion. The Rubicon Project Inc. did an initial public offering in 2014, and AppNexus was tipped to follow.But in 2015, Google made a move that showed how powerful it was in this market. Google removed YouTube inventory from ad exchanges run by other companies including AppNexus. With a few exceptions, any advertiser that wanted to market on YouTube had to use Googleâs software or ad exchange.Google saw a business rationale behind the decision. Outside exchanges handled less than 5% of YouTubeâs ad slots at the time, according to the company. Also, YouTubeâs most popular ad format -- a skippable one that ran before videos, called TrueView -- was &quot;not supported&quot; on external exchanges, YouTubeâs Faville said. Keeping such a small slice of ads available to buyers through other exchanges wasnât worth the extra work.However, OâKelley and others in the ad-tech industry saw the move as a clear example of Google using YouTubeâs assets to favor other parts of its business -- in this case, Googleâs ad software -- at the expense of rivals. Five percent of YouTube ads may not be important for Google, but itâs a vast amount for smaller competitors.Dina Srinivasan, a former executive at ad agency WPP Plc, compared Googleâs 2015 move to a company decreeing that investors can only trade popular shares on one stock exchange, and through one brokerage firm.Google ad prices are set in an auction and not public. But taking YouTube off outside exchanges probably reduced the number of marketers bidding on its ads, lowering prices, according to Srinivasan. âGoogle may have absorbed a loss in YouTube revenue for some other reason,â she added. âThe question regulators will be asking is whether that reason was to drive out competition.âDespite a short-term dent in YouTube sales, the ploy likely increased the long-term value of Google by billions of dollars because it strengthened the companyâs grip on advertising technology, according to OâKelley. &quot;Thatâs kind of how monopolies roll,&quot; he said.Thereâs a âno economic senseâ test in U.S. antitrust law that may apply here, according Srinivasan. The Justice Departmentâs top trustbuster Makan Delrahim discussed this in a recent speech about big tech companies. When oil refineries refused to sell themselves to Standard Oil in the late 19th century, the giant cut prices to drive them out of business. Lower prices are the essence of competition, but a powerful company is not allowed to do things that make no business sense just to make it harder for rivals to catch up, he said.YouTube said its tactics were sensible. &quot;Like any business, we make changes to how we operate to reflect the current climate,&quot; Faville said. &quot;We make all these decisions with the same goal: to improve the YouTube experience for our users, creators, and advertisers.&quot;Since Google changed the YouTube ad-buying process, much of the rest of the programmatic market has withered: Rubicon Project is trading about two-thirds below its IPO price; Rocket Fuel Inc.âs valuation fell below $100 million before it was acquired. The AppNexus IPO never happened and it sold to AT&T Inc. last year for $1.4 billion. The Trade Desk Inc. is a rare thriving player, but it operates in China and other markets where Google is less active.In 2016, several ad tech companies, including AppNexus, met with Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to discuss the industry, and some complained about YouTubeâs behavior, according to OâKelley. The response was tepid at best, he said.âWe had a really hard time getting them to pay attention,&quot; OâKelley recalled. &quot;They would say, âItâs hard to understand.â&quot; A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment, and the Department of Justice didnât respond to a request for comment.But now, OâKelley may have a more attentive audience. In May, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on digital advertising. &quot;This is not a functioning market,&quot; he said. &quot;It enables Google, which doesnât produce content, to monopolize all aspects of the programmatic business and take a disproportionate tax for its trouble.&quot;Later, over the phone, OâKelley was less grim about the political response. &quot;Maybe now theyâre paying attention,&quot; he said.To contact the reporters on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net;Mark Bergen in San Francisco at mbergen10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Emily BiusoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-15,205.21,204.5,-0.71,-0.00345987,Don't move,2,98,2597,102,3.9276087793608006
1344,2648,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-apple-stock-091625736.html?.tsrc=rss,3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Ahead of End-of-Month Earnings Report,2019-07-15,"In the latter part of 2018, bearishness took hold of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and sent shares to the $150 range as AAPL stock investors took in the news that the company would no longer issue unit sales numbers for its iconic iPhone device.Source: Shutterstock CEO Tim Cook reasoned that subscription and app sales mattered more for profitability. By that logic, Apple could afford to offer less transparency into its business each quarter. Now that the shares have recovered, there are three reasons investors should buy Apple stock. Weaker iPhone Sales ExpectedInvestors have had more than six months to accept that unit sales for iPhones will fall. Average selling price (ASP) is significantly higher with each successive release of the device. And although loyal customers will hold off upgrading to the latest iPhone, their device will stay in the iOS ecosystem. Even if revenue falls, Apple will enjoy healthy profit margins from sales of iPhone 8, X, XR, and XS Max.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsExpect the total profit per user to hold steady or increase, driven by more customers signing up for Apple Music. In April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had 28 million subscribers, 2 million more than Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT). SPOT stock trades at similar price/sales and price/book multiples compared to Apple. Yet Spotify's price/forward cash flow multiple is 75, compared to 20.5 times for Apple.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 Don't forget that Apple recently launched its News App. By sending notifications for timely news, users who use the app often may end up subscribing to the service. In doing so, they get Apple News Plus, which gives users access to premium newspapers and more than 300 digital magazines.  Look for Earnings Beat on July 30When Apple reports quarterly earnings on July 30, the company may beat the Q2/2019 EPS estimate of $2.12.Source: TipranksLast year, Apple reported earnings of $2.34, topping the $2.17 estimate. Strong revenues are possible because Apple Music subscription growth is gaining momentum. The iPad and iPad Mini refresh could drive device sales higher. Conversely, the iPad Pro faces stiff competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Surface book and Surface tablet. Still, Apple has the AirPod, Watch, and HomePod to offset a drop in Pro sales.In the unlikely scenario that AAPL stock falls after reporting strong results, the drop gives investors a chance to average down. Most who invest in Apple are in it for the long term. Viewing short-term drops in the stock as entry points played out well in the last decade.  * 10 Stocks to Sell for an Economic Slowdown To be sure, weak iPhone sales could spook investors and send Apple stock lower. Yet if consumers are simply holding off on upgrades in general, Apple is not losing market share. So if users are not leaving the iOS ecosystem for Android, Apple subscription and software sales will return high profits. Service Revenue Will Drive GrowthThe second quarter 2019 saw Apple report its best quarter ever for Services, as revenue topped $11.5 billion. Even as worldwide iPhone revenue fell 17%, Services grew to new heights, with more than 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, up 30 million in the last quarter. During 2020, Apple expects to surpass 500 million subscriptions.That is a phenomenal rate of growth. And the strong uptake of Services will include growing App sales. In Q2, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40%. Apple has a well-diversified source of revenue from apps; the biggest third-party subscription app accounted for just 0.3% of its total Services revenue.Apple forecast revenue of $52.5 billion - $54.5 billion for the upcoming report for the June quarter. Gross margin will be around 38%. Operating expenditures will be $8.7 billion - $8.8 billion. Your Takeaway on AAPL StockApple is confident about the growing revenue from the product category level. More importantly, it expects iPhone sales improving Y/Y in the upcoming Q3 report. Cash flow generation is so strong that AAPL stock repurchase authorization and its quarterly dividend. A dividend hike is unlikely but if Apple does so, look for Apple stock continuing its uptrend.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1345,2649,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealthiest-1-good-everybody-063015723.html?.tsrc=rss,The Wealthiest 1% Can Be Good for Everybody,2019-07-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The share of income and wealth going to the so-called â1%â has incensed protesters and agitated economists around the world. From the Occupy Wall StreetÂ movementÂ to the work of academics such as Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman, attention has zeroed in on what the super-rich earn and own, and on how governments should use taxes for redistribution.Such policy ideas have taken center stage in the primaries of the U.S. Democratic Party, which decide who will challengeÂ President Donald Trump in 2020. One of the runners, Senator Elizabeth Warren,Â advocates a 2% wealth tax on fortunes above $50 million. She has found unlikely billionaireÂ allies, including the investor George Soros and Facebook Inc.âs co-founder Chris Hughes, who say theyâd accept a levy on their riches to âhelp address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes.âThese are all smart people but thereâs a danger they may be missing something here. The French economistÂ Philippe Aghion points out that thereâs a direct correlation between high levels of inequality in favor of the top 1% and innovation (the creation of new technologies). Given that every country is eager to foster innovation âÂ because it brings huge economic benefits âÂ might there be an argument that a concentration of wealth atÂ the top isnât necessarily a great evil?Aghionâs view isÂ that instead of seeking to punish the 1%, the main priority for governments should be to ensure that the top strata of the wealthy isnât allowed to remain a closed shop âÂ that is,Â new innovators must be free to challenge and replace incumbent companies. Given the entrenched positions of giant technology companies such as Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., this is going to need a bit of work.The London School of Economics professor, who presented his findings in Paris last month, also said there was no evidence that faster innovation would produce more inequality further down the income scale. This is only about the difference between the 1% and the rest. And he said increases in innovation were linked to better social mobility.Â Aghion believes that new inventions give people the chance toÂ rise up the ladder faster.Indeed, mobility (admittedly at the top end) is the prime motivation for all those technology pioneers in the first place.Â They want to make enoughÂ money to join the ranks of the very wealthiest.Â Aghionâs conclusion, in line with the tradition of the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, is straightforward: Companies come up with new processes and products to generate and appropriate ârents.â Governments shouldnât target these extra profits excessivelyÂ since it would stifle the desire to innovate.This doesnât meanÂ thereâs no role for public policy. Quite the opposite. Aghion also showed how all is not well in innovation-land. The growth rate of total factor productivity, a measure of efficiency, rose sharply in the 10 years after 1996Â but then declined. In particular, productivity growth among tech companies and firms that are the biggest technology users appears to have peaked respectively in the mid-1990s and in the mid-2000s, and has slumped subsequently.Meanwhile, as the academics Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout have shown, companies are becoming ever more able to charge markups in excess of their costs.Â Yesterdayâs innovators are enjoying a quietly untroubled and lucrative life today, which may well be down to the barriers to entry they themselves have erected.While many on the left hanker after higher taxes to shrink the share of income and wealth of the 1%, itâs not even clear that theyâre an effective tool. Aghion looked at the tax reforms introduced by the French president Francois Hollande in 2012, including a 75% tax on earnings above 1 million euros. He found that the changes prompted more of the ultra-rich to leave France but that any improvement in social mobility â measured as the number of people who have moved upward in the bottom 95% of the income scale between 2011 and 2015 â was extremely limited (although itâs too soon to draw strong conclusions).So if we want to encourage the bursts of innovation that actually supportÂ genuine upward mobility, tackling the quasi-monopolistic practices of the biggest companies might be a better use of political energy.Â For years, Amazon.com Inc., FacebookÂ  Inc., Google and their ilk have been subject to relatively little antitrust scrutiny. This may be changing: The European UnionÂ has fined Google three times for a total of about 8.2 billion euros ($9.3 billion) for abusing its dominant position. There are signs too that U.S. antitrust authorities are finally wakingÂ up to this problem.Of course, proponents of higher taxesÂ on wealth and income believe they can foster competition and social mobility.Â If they fund improvements in education, such thinking goes, that may help todayâs poor become tomorrowâs champions. But Franceâs experience in 2012 poses questions about how much can be raised before wealthy individuals moveÂ abroad. In the U.S.Â thereâs a vocal debate over how much Warrenâs wealth tax would actually bring in.The rise of left-wing politicians such as Warren and Britainâs Jeremy Corbyn suggests a hunger among younger voters for much greater redistribution. While higher taxation may make the world fairer, thereâs little evidence it will make the economy innovate more or grow faster. Robust competition enforcement is a better answer.

1347,2651,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-5-billion-u-privacy-202029227.html?.tsrc=rss,Facebook $5 Billion U.S. Privacy Settlement Approved by FTC,2019-07-11,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. officials approved a record $5 billion privacy settlement with Facebook Inc. to resolve the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, people said, prompting an immediate outcry from lawmakers and privacy advocates who said it didnât go far enough.Although details of the settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission werenât announced, the fine is steep but far from devastating for Facebook. The company, which reported revenue of almost $56 billion in 2018, had set aside $3 billion in anticipation of the fine.âThis reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,â said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who called for a hearing on the agreement. âSuch a financial punishment for purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year,â Blumenthal said.The FTCâs settlement was approved by a vote of 3-2, according to two people who asked not to be named because they werenât authorized to speak publicly about the decision. The agreement still needs approval from the Justice Department.The resolution caps a probe that opened in March 2018 after news that Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm hired by President Donald Trumpâs campaign, obtained user data from a researcher who created a personality quiz app on the social network.The settlement is the largest privacy fine in the FTCâs history and also marks the most significant action yet against Facebook over a series of mishaps that have compromised usersâ data and sent the company reeling from one crisis to another. The agencyâs two Democratic commissioners, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, voted against it, according to one of the people.Slaughter, Chopra, Facebook and the FTC declined to comment.Democratic Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Warner of Virginia also criticized the settlement, as did House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is conducting an antitrust investigation of Facebook and other technology giants.The job of defending the settlement will fall to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, who has tried to avoid split enforcement decisions as head of the agency.While Facebook had agreed to give its board oversight of its privacy policies, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is the controlling board member with nearly 58% of the voting power. The board also includes Facebookâs other top executive, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The two already have power over the companyâs privacy policies.Public interest groups including Public Knowledge, Public Citizen and the Open Markets Institute said any deal with the FTC should impose remedies that would rein in Facebookâs data collection practices in addition to a fine.âSomething clearly has to be done to strengthen the data protection practices of that company,â said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which filed a complaint against Facebook that led to the FTCâs 2011 consent decree with the social-media company that addressed a litany of deceptive practices.Tech industry group NetChoice praised the fine, saying it would motivate companies to improve their privacy practices.The Cambridge Analytica incident stems from a personality-quiz app offered to Facebook users by a Cambridge University researcher. About 270,000 people downloaded the app, allowing the researcher to access data about those individuals and their friends. The information was subsequently sold to Cambridge Analytica.Even as it resolves the FTC privacy inquiry, Facebook is still grappling with regulatory scrutiny on several other fronts -- including the prospect of a new investigation by the FTCâs antitrust section under an agreement with the Justice Department that divided oversight of four of the biggest tech companies. One area of focus is likely to be the companyâs acquisitions of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the Whatsapp messaging service.Elsewhere in the U.S., the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Separately, the attorney general for Washington, D.C., has sued the company, claiming it failed to safeguard usersâ data. Other state attorneys general are also investigating.Facebook declined to comment on the status of those probes.The settlement ranks among the highest at the FTC, which reached a $10 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG in 2016 for deceptive advertising in the emission-cheating scandal involving diesel models. The agencyâs previous record fine in a privacy action came in 2012, when Alphabet Inc.âs Google paid $22.5 million to settle claims it misrepresented its privacy assurances to Apple Inc.âs Safari users.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner and Naomi Nix.To contact the reporters on this story: David McLaughlin in Washington at dmclaughlin9@bloomberg.net;Daniel Stoller in Arlington at dstoller1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-11,201.75,203.3,1.55,0.007682776,Don't move,1,8,771,10,1.297016861219196

But Amazon âcelebratesâ Prime Day. Many chief executives write notes to their shareholders. But Jeff Bezos pens annual letters with âlessonsâ and âprinciple themesâ and âimportant wordsâ to behold. Many companies open satellite offices. Amazon âlaunchedâ HQ2Â with a continent-wide pitch contest. And many companies train their employees. On Thursday, Amazon announcedÂ how much itâs spending on workplaceÂ training over the next six years: more than $700 million.Certainly, when a company has a market value near $1 trillion and a workforce of more than 600,000, each move is a bigger deal than a back-to-school sale at an independent bookstore. Yet, even among its technology industry peers, the e-commerce giant seems to have a magic touch, turning run-of-the-mill corporate events into big moments.As of last year, Google quietly amassed more than 7,000 employees in New York. But when Amazon said it was coming to town, the world was transfixed. And when it abandoned those plans, the governor scrambled. After all the fuss, Amazon ended up sending some workers to New York anyway.I told you almost two years ago about how Amazon was turning its earnings calls into marketing events and how it deftly used Whole Foods as an opportunity to highlight Amazonâs low, low prices. The company has marketing down pat. Thatâs not to say Amazon is all talk. The company did raise its minimum pay to $15 an hourÂ last year. Thatâs real. And surely Amazon will work to retrain its U.S. employees.But letâs break down the numbers of this training program. Amazon said itâll spend about $700 million on development for 100,000 employees by 2025. Thatâs $1,077 a person annually. According to one estimate from the Association for Talent Development, a trade group, the average organization spends $1,296 per employee annually on training. Well, youâve got to admire Amazonâs commitment to undercutting the competition.Amazon is a humongous corporation. Training lots of people costs a great deal of money. In a world increasingly worried about monopolies, thereâs a curious element to a company seeking praise just for being big.Bezos isnât the first technology idol to entrance the world. Steve Jobs was famous for creating a so-called reality distortion field at Apple. Bill Gates recently described his old foe in mystical terms, saying âcasting spellsâ was part of Jobsâs aura. âI would see people mesmerized,â Gates said.Â âBut because Iâm a minor wizard, the spells donât work on me.âWe should all aspire to be minor wizards when it comes to corporate pronouncements. Some claims, likeÂ ubiquitous drone deliveryÂ by 2018, will fail to materialize. Others are less impressive when you see how the magic trick is performed.This article also ran in Bloomberg Technologyâs Fully Charged newsletter.

1361,2689,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-high-end-echo-100000928.html?.tsrc=rss,"Amazon Plans High-End Echo, Ramps Up Work on Alexa Home Robot",2019-07-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is developing a higher quality version of the Echo speaker and ramping up work on its home robot.The company plans to release the new Echo by next year, according to people familiar with the product. Prototypes of the cylindrical speaker are wider than the current Echo to squeeze in additional components including at least four tweeters, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. The robot, previously reported by Bloomberg, has wheels and can be controlled by Alexa voice commands, the people said.Both devices are being developed by Amazon Lab126, a research and development arm based in Sunnyvale, California. The companyâs hardware foray keeps customers wedded to its ecosystem -- buying products from Amazon.com and using services like Prime Video and Prime Music.The Echo, which went on sale in 2015, will grab 63% of the U.S. market this year, according to EMarketer. But it has lost some ground to the Sonos One, Apple Inc. HomePod and Google Home Max -- all of which claim to deliver superior audio. Google now has 31% of the market, while the rest have a combined 12%. The HomePod isnât selling as well as Apple expected, and the company recently dropped the price.Amazon has previously attempted to improve the Echoâs sound with tweaks and offered a standalone subwoofer and device that links the speakers to a stereo. Amazon is also planning a high-fidelity version of its music service, according to Music Business Worldwide, that should mesh better with the new Echo. Amazon could still decide not to proceed with the new high-end Echo.The Seattle-based company typically rolls out a slew of devices in the fall, but sometimes scatters one-off product launches throughout the year. Amazon plans to start selling voice-controlled earbuds to rival Appleâs AirPods as early as this year, Bloomberg reported in April. The Echo range will also receive minor updates this fall, people familiar with the plans said.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.Amazon originally intended to reveal the robot, known internally as âVesta,â as early as this year, but the machine isnât ready to be mass-produced, the people said. While Amazon could choose never to release the robot, in recent months it has pulled engineers from other projects to work on it -- a signal the company plans to sell Vesta at some point.Itâs unclear what tasks the Amazon robot might perform. People familiar with the project speculated last year that the Vesta could be a sort of mobile Alexa, accompanying customers in parts of their home where they donât have Echo devices.People familiar with the project describe prototypes that are about waist-high and navigate with the help of an array of computer-vision cameras. In an internal demonstration, an engineer summoned the machine with his voice.Amazon has said nothing publicly about Vesta, but a year ago, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos posted an Instagram photo of an Echo speaker taped to a Roomba vacuum cleaner. âWhat?!!!!â he wrote. âFound this in the living room when I got home. I have no idea.

1364,2692,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-facto-social-media-sidekick-080002644.html?.tsrc=rss,Trump Is Sending Missouriâs Junior Senator After Silicon Valley,2019-07-12,"(Bloomberg) -- When Josh Hawley, the freshman U.S. senator from Missouri, introduced a bill last monthÂ proposing a major change to one of theÂ foundational laws of the modern internet, he was largelyÂ pilloried. Hawleyâs ideaÂ â to make big techÂ companies convince the FTC theyâre politically neutral if they want to continueÂ receiving a crucial immunity from legal liability theyâve enjoyed for the last 20 yearsÂ â was described as unserious and unworkable. Not a single lawmaker signed onto the bill as a co-sponsor.Â Hawley finally got a major endorsement on Thursday. President Donald Trump praised the bill at the White Houseâs social media summitÂ â a gathering of rightwing figures who claim to be the victims of Silicon Valleyâs liberal bias. The president then announced he was asking large social media companies â who were conspicuously absent from the first meetingÂ â to come to the White House in the coming weeks and hash things out with Hawley, other unnamed legislators and administration officials.It was a major validation for Hawley, who has positioned himself as the rightâs main Silicon Valley antagonist. While he has expressed concerns about the industryâs market power and privacy practices, Hawley has attracted the most attention when focusing on the main preoccupationÂ of Republican techÂ critics: the supposed liberal bias of social mediaÂ companies.Â âThis has risen to theÂ level of abortion, guns and taxes for grassroots Republicans,â said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist who has worked for Steve Bannon and the White House, and is now Donald Trump Jr.âs spokesman. âThe White House holding this summit, and HawleyÂ introducing the bill, those are just reflections ofÂ what theÂ Republican base wants on this issue,â he said.Â âI think it was reallyÂ meant to launch the first bullet in the next big tech wars.âÂ Â Hawley has effectively created a way to act on the free-form discontent with tech that Trump and others on the right have been articulating with mounting frequency. Heâs done so by pulling a law known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act out of the confines of internet legal conferences and directly into the center of the online culture wars. Hawley has been signaling his intentions even before he took office. Two weeks after unseating Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill, Hawley posted a Twitter message hinting that CongressÂ should punish the social networkÂ if it couldnât prove it was pursuingÂ âtrue diversity of political discourse.âÂ The words were a coded reference to Section 230, whichÂ exempts internet platforms fromÂ political liability for content posted by their users. This immunity is widely credited with making it possible to run a site like Twitter or Facebook without being crushed by libel lawsuits.Dissatisfaction with Section 230 has been building for several years. Liberals charge that it has allowed tech companies to grow complacent about misinformation and harassment on their platforms. Conservatives often claim â incorrectly â that the immunity was meant to be predicated on political neutrality. The malcontents havenât coalesced around a solution, in part because the available alternatives are all problematic. The blowback to Hawleyâs bill over the last month illustrated this. Conservative groups like theÂ AmericanÂ EnterpriseÂ InstituteÂ andÂ Americans for ProsperityÂ argued that Hawleyâs plan would centralize power with unelected bureaucrats; Michiganâs RepresentativeÂ Justin Amash, an Independent, called it aÂ âsweetheart deal for Big Government.â Those like Surabian that were more sympathetic to Hawleyâs idea described it as an opening volley, something that its harshest critics dismissed out of hand. The bill hasÂ âno redeeming features; no interesting policy ideas to consider for future proposals; no meritoriousÂ conservation starters,â wrote Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa ClaraÂ Universityâs School of Law who has been one of Section 230âs mostÂ vocal supporters, in an essay this week. Tech companies seem unsure how to handle this moment. The backlash poses real peril, and the industry has increased its spending on lobbying in Washington, all while offering to adhere to new rules on issues like privacy. But thereâs also a widespread feeling that Washington doesnât understand tech â a conviction that deepens every time a lawmaker asks an embarrassingly uninformed question at a public hearing.Â Â  Michael Beckerman, executive director of the Internet Association, which represents all the primary targets of the social media summit, said critics like Hawley risk damaging the economy with policies based on a misunderstanding about how tech works.Â  âThereâs a bit ofÂ confusion about the role of these platforms,â heÂ said.Â âItâs not aÂ public square. These are privateÂ companies, and itâs within theirÂ right to have community standards.âHawley interprets criticism as evidence of Silicon Valleyâs influence.Â âYou see it every time I or somebody elseÂ makes a proposalÂ â usually itâs me,â he said.Â âThe Google chorus swings into action.â Following anÂ interview, his staff quickly provided a list of right-leaning groups who have criticized his bill and received financial support from technology companies.Â Six months in Washington has proved to Hawley that the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, he said, is even worse than he thought. Hawley said he never wanted to be a politician, but he has a strange biography for a political outsider. A straight-laced graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, heâs a former law professor married to a current law professor; the two met when they were both clerking forÂ Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Hawley began poking at the tech industry in late 2017 as Missouriâs attorney general, when he opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet Inc.âs Google.Â It attracted nationwide media attention just as Hawleyâs Senate run was ramping up, but dissipated before having any tangible impact. Itâs a pattern that HawleyâsÂ critics say foreshadowed his practices in the Senate.Â Hawley said heÂ thought SiliconÂ Valley was doing important work when he spoke withÂ Bloomberg News in early 2018, but his views on tech have coarsened noticeably since then.Â In an essay in USAÂ Today this May he questioned whether the country would be better off ifÂ Facebook disappeared entirely.Â In an interview over the fourth of July weekend, Hawley pointed to the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing as a reminder of how unimpressed he is about the current state of American technological innovation. &quot;What theyâve delivered are these more refined behavior ad platform businesses. They've not only failed to live up toÂ expectations, but in many ways have been harmful to the country andÂ the economy,â heÂ said. Hawley doesnât exactly say that what he wantedÂ instead of Twitter was flying cars, but you getÂ the point.Â While the bill addressing Section 230 has clear ideological undertones, Hawley has argued that concerns about the tech industry shouldnât necessarily be partisan. HeâsÂ sponsored about a half-dozen bills related to tech, often inÂ cooperation with Democrats, includingÂ proposals to create aÂ âdo not trackâ list for online data collection,Â stronger protections for children online, and restrictions on novel forms of video game-based gambling. When he isnâtÂ introducing legislation orÂ hammering the tech industryÂ inÂ public hearings, Hawley enjoys penning open letters. He's written to Facebook Inc. toÂ question its commitment to privacy, to Apple Inc. to suggest it add aÂ âdo not trackâ option to its app store, and to Google, insinuating that shortcomings in its translation software stem from itsÂ attempts to cozy up to the Chinese government.Â Hawleyâs work onÂ privacyÂ issues specifically have earned him a reputation among Democrats as the rare Republican willing to sign onto legislation pursuing what are seen asÂ broadly held principles. Several people cited his age â at 39 heâs the Senateâs youngest member â as one of his qualifications to speak on tech issues. âItâs great to work with a Republican partner who isÂ thinking deeply about these issuesÂ and, in this body especially, who has a young personâs fresh perspective,â said Virginiaâs Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat andÂ Hawleyâs co-sponsor on a bill imposing transparency requirements on companies that collect personal data.The prospects for any legislation arenât great in 2019âs Washington. In such an atmosphere, legislative proposals often serve as a way to reframeÂ the idea of what is possible. Hawleyâs bill on Section 230 seems to be doing that. Lindsey Graham suggested at a hearing this weekÂ that restricting access to its protections could be used to pressure tech companies. Ted Cruz referred to the law as a subsidy for tech, and said he was interested in re-examining it. If nothing else, Hawley is playing a note that is increasingly resonant in Republican politics. Industry groups and many academics view these developments with alarm. On Thursday, a groupÂ of 50 internet law experts published aÂ list of principles for lawmakersÂ considering modifying Section 230, an implicit acknowledgement that this is a growing possibility.Â Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor at the U.S.Â Naval Academy who recently wrote a book about Section 230, said tech companies have seen the lawâs protections as justification to ignore legitimate complaints. âCongress, with one vote and a signature from the president, could get rid of all of Section 230,â said Kosseff, who believes it was inevitable that someone like Hawley was going to come along. âThatâs what Iâve been trying to beat into their heads. âGuys, you have to take this seriously.ââÂ To contact the author of this story: Joshua Brustein in New York at jbrustein@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Emily Biuso at ebiuso@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-07-12,203.3,205.21,1.91,0.009394983,Don't move,1,11,1487,13,0.8742434431741762
1365,2693,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-pays-price-stay-bleeding-043010426.html?.tsrc=rss,Apple Pays the Price to Stay at the Bleeding Edge,2019-07-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. looks like it may put down close to $1 billion just to keep its devices at the leading edge.Â Japan Display Inc., one of its key providers of screens, saidÂ Friday morning it would get up to $400 million from bailout partner Harvest Tech Investment Management Co.Â Nestled into its two-page stock exchangeÂ statement was the revelation that the funding includes $100 million already pledged by a customer.That customer is Apple, according to a Bloomberg News story published in late June. Taiwanâs TPK Holding Co., another long-time iPhone component supplier, had been in talks to join a $1.1 billion rescue package for Japan Display but pulled out. That left the company needing to look elsewhere, and Apple stepped in to help fill the void.This development comes a week after Appleâs main screen supplier, Samsung Electronics Co., made a cryptic reference to a âone-time gain related to the display businessâ in its preliminary second-quarter earnings statement. The U.S. company will pay as much as 1 trillion won ($850 million) to make up for a shortfall in purchases of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, according to South Koreaâs Electronics Times and analysts at Citigroup Global Markets. (Apple hadnât repliedÂ to a request for comment by publication time Friday.)Whatâs interesting about both these cases is that neither of the payments appears to be for purchasing components directly. Rather, they are simply to prop up or compensate suppliers that Apple uses toÂ manufacture the most advanced screens available. Samsung is among companies that preceded Apple in incorporating OLED displays in smartphones, yetÂ the iPhone maker is the only one that buys them by the tens of millions. It relies on Samsungâs display division to make that happen.Â Apple probably locked in that supply by promising to buy a minimum amount, and it may have fallen short given recent weakness in iPhone growth. At the same time, the U.S. company desperately needs alternative sources to ensure itâs not beholden to any one supplier. Thatâs where a Japan Display bailout comes in. The Japanese company said its 20.4 billion yen ($188 million) operating loss in the March quarter was wider than the prior period âas a result of R&D expenses for preparation of OLED mass production.âJapan Display being able to make lots of OLED screens is great news for Apple âÂ as long as it doesnât go belly-up before that happens. Apple, therefore, has an incentive to keep the company afloat.With global smartphone brands running out of novel ways toÂ spice up their offerings, itâs crucial for premium devices such as the iPhone to maintain technological leadership. In a downturn, Appleâs starting to find out the price of staying at the bleeding edge.Â To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1377,2774,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-volkswagen-throwing-rocks-silicon-175749099.html?.tsrc=rss,Ford and Volkswagen: Throwing Rocks at Silicon Valley,2019-07-09,"Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) has decided to turn away from Silicon Valley and back toward the car business for its future.VLKAY dropped their alliance with Aurora Innovation, a self-driving startup backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Instead it is now in talks with Ford (NYSE:F) for electric and autonomous car technology.Volkswagen's Modular Electric Drive Kit (MEB) will eventually be married to Argo AI, a start-up for autonomous vehicles Ford invested in back in 2017.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 The loser is Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) Waymo unit, which seems to have the best autonomous tech but whose proposed agreements were believed to be one-sided by the industry. Amazon and Aurora are still working with Korean nameplates Hyundai and Kia. Waymo is expected to wind up with Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi. The Ford/VLKAY DealUnder their deal, Ford and Volkswagen will place their strengths into one another's hands starting in 2022. Ford will make pick-ups for Europe under the VW nameplate, while VW will produce a city van Ford can sell. Volkswagen is going full speed ahead with the MEB platform in China, where a joint venture called SAIC Volkswagen will begin making up to 300,000 vehicles per year in 2020. Another joint venture, FAW-Volkswagen in Foshan, recently doubled its capacity to 600,000 vehicles, although some are gas-powered.For Volkswagen, its electric car alliances in China are a way to get past its Dieselgate scandal. The scandal led to the firing of Audi's CEO, over 7.000 layoffs, and tens of billions of dollars in fines and court costs.For Ford, the VW alliance gives it a stable electric vehicle platform and control over its path in self-driving cars. It could also bring Ford back into markets like Europe, South America, and Africa, from which it had been retreating. It's also a step back for CEO Jim Hackett, who was brought in two years ago in part because he had connections to Silicon Valley as head of Steelcase, a furniture company. What Comes NextVolkswagen is roughly twice the size of Ford. It has a market cap of about $86 billion, against $40 billion for Ford. Its sales last year came to about $264 billion, against $160 billion for Ford. Despite Dieselgate, VW sells for one-third its sales while Ford sells for one-fourth.The market poverty of the car business, compared with technology, where companies frequently sell for 8-10 times sales, has created an unequal balance. It may have led Waymo to push terms the auto industry could not abide. The car makers are now teaming up and sharing costs because, if they wanted, Waymo, Amazon, or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could build their own factories. The combined market cap of Ford and Volkswagen, about $120 billion, still pales in comparison to Amazon's $943 billion.The car makers insist no one has learned how to make money in electrics or autonomous cars. They insist even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hasn't cracked the puzzle, although its success in the luxury segment recently cost BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) CEO Harold Kruger his job. This came just months after BMW signed a manufacturing alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Bottom LineThe Ford-VW tie-up is a defensive alliance that boosts China and begins what may be the auto industry's last stand against Silicon Valley.Making electric cars takes fewer employees than making gas-powered cars.

Since mid-April, QCOM stock has moved from $55 to $88, to $65 to $70, before settling in at a current price above $76. But while the recent shifts are larger than usual, QCOM stock has seen big moves for several years now.For the last five years, Qualcomm stock has mostly moved sideways -- the stock was actually down 6% over that period -- but with a number of peaks and valleys along the way. QCOM stock has been a trader's darling for two key reasons.First, Qualcomm is a leader in chips used for smartphones. Key customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its stock significantly outperform QCOM. But it, too, has seen a few sharp moves. Investor attitudes toward Apple have risen and fallen along with the company's product cycle -- and QCOM in some cases has gone along for the ride.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecond, Qualcomm's business model has been under various forms of attack for most of that period. And it has been the effectiveness of those attacks, and the threat of new ones, that has driven investors in and out of Qualcomm stock.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 That hasn't changed in 2019. If anything, the debate over Qualcomm's model has intensified. Understanding that debate is essential to understanding QCOM stock. Antitrust Concerns Are Nothing NewRegulators have had their eyes on Qualcomm for years. The European Commission, driven by complaints from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), and others, began its initial antitrust probe back in 2005. The investigation was eventually canceled in 2009 after the complaints were withdrawn.One reason those complaints were withdrawn, however, was that the suppliers managed a win in South Korea. In 2009, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $207 million (the figure was reduced by about 18% this year) for unfairly using its dominance in mobile phone chips. With customers moving on to new chips, the changes driven by South Korea's action and the resources used in Europe led the claimants to move on.Regulators in Asia and Europe weren't finished, however. In 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million to settle antitrust litigation in China -- the largest fine in that country's history. The next year, South Korea hit the company again, this time for $853 million.A new investigation in Europe ended with a $1.2 billion levy in 2018. Another fine reportedly is on the way. Taiwan got $774 million last year as well. All told, Qualcomm has paid nearly $4 billion in antitrust fines worldwide. What Regulators Are Saying About QCOMThe fine print of the allegations vary modestly from country-to-country, but the basic complaint is the same: Qualcomm is using its patent power to cement its monopoly. As EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager put it last year:&quot;Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance. Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals.&quot;The problem in regulators' view is that Qualcomm charges for its chips -- but it also charges to license the associated patents. It then provides rebates that are conditioned on exclusively buying Qualcomm products. Regulators argue that those rebates, in particular, keep potential rivals -- among them Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) -- out of the mobile baseband chip market.The problem for Qualcomm here is twofold: First, it risks more fines in new jurisdictions. Second, this system is quite profitable for Qualcomm. As Apple has termed it, Qualcomm is &quot;double dipping&quot; in gaining both product and licensing revenue. Losing that ability would hurt Qualcomm revenue and profits.Most notably, the company's licensing revenue is extremely high-margin. In fiscal 2017, pre-tax profit margins (not gross margins -- operating margins, essentially) in the licensing business were 80%. Every dollar of licensing revenue lost suggests, even after taxes, close to 70 cents of lost net income. It's not a surprise, then, that investors showed caution toward Qualcomm stock as antitrust questions piled up. Apple Takes on QualcommWhat really got investor attention, however, wasn't a regulator, but a customer. Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion in early 2017, kicking off a bruising legal battle. QCOM stock dropped 12% on the news, as Apple accused the company of inflating royalties. Qualcomm countersued. Apple instructed contract manufacturers like Foxconn Technology (OTCMKTS:FXCOF) to withhold royalties, which hammered Qualcomm profits.Qualcomm stock would hit a 20-month low later in 2017. A takeover attempt by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) spiked the stock -- but in March 2018, President Donald Trump quashed the deal, and QCOM stock hit the lows again. Another rally would fade along with a sell-off in semiconductor stocks. By February of this year, QCOM was back below $50.Apple's efforts hurt Qualcomm earnings and putting pressure on QCOM shares. Then, out of nowhere, Apple settled. The risk of a loss in that case -- which could color antitrust sentiment worldwide -- came off the table. Billions of dollars in back payments were set to flow into Qualcomm's coffers.QCOM stock gained 23% on the first day and kept rising. It would barely clear $90 in May, if briefly. At that point, Qualcomm stock had risen almost 60% in just a couple of weeks. Over that span, Qualcomm added nearly $40 billion in market value.It appeared as if the worst was over. Antitrust issues overseas had been largely settled. Apple (including its contract manufacturers) and Samsung combined generated 40% of revenue in fiscal 2016 -- and Qualcomm was apparently on good terms with both key customers. 5G was on the way. The naysayers had been proven wrong. After years of volatile and sideways trading, Qualcomm was set to jump-start growth. The U.S. Gets Involved With QCOM AntitrustA lot of news surrounded Qualcomm from 2017 to 2018. There were antitrust fines in Taiwan and Europe. Broadcom was trying to buy Qualcomm, while Qualcomm was trying to buy NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in a deal that eventually broke after some 20 months of effort. The Qualcomm-Apple battle garnered headlines. And there were the arguments about the fate of smartphone unit growth -- a key source of pressure on Apple stock -- and the timing and size of the opportunity in 5G.Amid all that action, investors somewhat forgot that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had decided to get in on the antitrust action. The FTC charged Qualcomm with anticompetitive behavior in January 2017. Two days later, the Apple suit was filed. Headlines surrounding that battle somewhat displaced the FTC effort.And as the case dragged on, its relevance seemed minimal. Qualcomm stock had not been very impacted by past antitrust settlements; even a U.S. effort would be much the same. Settlement talks were held last October, suggesting the pending removal of yet another headwind to QCOM stock.That analysis turned out to be wrong, however. QCOM stock had one more big move in it. A Monopoly Ruling, and QCOM Stock TumblesOn May 21, U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of the FTC. Qualcomm stock already had been struggling amid the Huawei blacklist and generally weak sentiment toward semiconductor stocks. It would fall 11% in trading the day after Koh's ruling.Koh found that Qualcomm's &quot;no license, no chips&quot; policy was anti-competitive. The judge cited three reasons:First, Qualcomm refused to allow rivals licenses to standard-essential patents (SEPs). That meant that end customers like Apple or Samsung had to license those patents from Qualcomm even if they used chips from another customer.Second, the rates it charged for those SEPs were &quot;unreasonably high,&quot; as the judge wrote in her opinion. On occasion, Koh wrote, Qualcomm charged higher licensing fees when manufacturers used other chips -- in a clear effort to prevent those customers from doing so.Third, the rebates and market share discounts offered by Qualcomm further harmed competition, allowing Qualcomm to use its existing market share to prevent competitors from entering.Koh clearly had the famous Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) antitrust case in mind; she cites that case liberally in her decision. From a broad standpoint, her argument is much the same: Smartphone manufacturers need Qualcomm modems just like PC manufacturers needed the Microsoft operating system. And, like Microsoft in the 1990s, Qualcomm has capitalized on that need to generate more revenue than it would have otherwise -- and to keep its competitors from having a piece of the market. The Importance of SEPs and FRANDParticularly in the context of Apple settling with Qualcomm, Koh's argument appears quite thin at first glance. As the patent holder, isn't Qualcomm entitled to monetize the IP which it spent -- and still spends -- billions of dollars developing? Why, exactly, can the government decide what licensing rates are &quot;unreasonably high&quot;?It's because of the importance of SEPs. The standards created in tech industries, in particular, generally are set by standard-setting organizations, or SSOs. These efforts are hugely important to ensure that an iPhone can call a Samsung, and vice versa. Without agreed-upon industry standards, interoperability would be significantly hampered -- causing harm to consumers and businesses alike.As Koh notes on page 125 of her decision, the Microsoft case is instructive. The Ninth Circuit held that &quot;SSOs requir[e] members who hold IP rights in standard-essential patents to agree to license those patents to all comers on [FRAND] terms (emphasis in original).&quot;As part of those SSOs, Qualcomm agreed to abide by those rules. It can't charge whatever it wants for licensing. It can't coerce or entice customers to exclusively use its chips. FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) pricing prevails.This is the case antitrust authorities have made against Qualcomm in so many overseas jurisdictions. It's the argument Apple made as well. A U.S. judge has taken their side, which projects an enormous impact on Qualcomm's business model. What That Means for Qualcomm StockMake no mistake: Koh's ruling will be trouble for Qualcomm if it is upheld. Licensing revenue would take a hit -- and that's a problem. Going back to fiscal 2016, before the Apple battle led to lower licensing revenue, the importance of licensing is apparent.Qualcomm's QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) unit generated $15.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year as shipments fell. Its pre-tax margins were 12%. Segment profit was $1.81 billion.QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) revenue came in at $7.6 billion -- less than half that of QCT. But margins were a staggering 85%. That business generated profit of $6.53 billion.In other words, licensing accounted for 78% of total earnings. Even in FY18, with Apple's suppliers withholding billions of dollars in revenue, QTL still generated 54% of the company's profit. Those total profits, at the segment level, unsurprisingly were 22% lower than they were two years ago -- in large part due to Apple's withdrawal.Licensing revenue is massively important to QCOM's bottom line. But Koh's ruling could suggest that Qualcomm can't license its patents and sell its chips to the same customer for the same reasons. That would lower sales and reduce licensing revenue, the most profitable revenue Qualcomm has -- and in fact the most profitable revenue pretty much anyone in tech has.Qualcomm might have to lower its rates for other customers. The company would also have to license its technology to rivals, potentially allowing Intel and others into the baseband modem space. Given that Intel's weakness appears to be the key reason why Apple settled in the first place, that suggests more competition as well.Lower sales, lower margins, and more competition: it's a tough combination for Qualcomm. A Short Seller Highlights the Risk to Qualcomm StockBack in January, Kerrisdale Capital released its short case for QCOM stock based on the prediction that Qualcomm would lose in court. The firm estimated a revenue loss of $2.7 billion: 12% of fiscal 2018 sales. It projected that such a hit would lead EPS to plunge to $1.64 annually, due, again, to the impact on margins.As such, Kerrisdale concluded, QCOM stock potentially could fall as far as $21. That's not far off from back-of-the-envelope calculations that assume a roughly 13x P/E multiple broadly in line with the likes of INTC and AVGO.That seems too bearish at this point. The Apple settlement changes the calculations, though it's possible Apple could look to renegotiate should the FTC prevail. And it's unwise to simply take a short-seller's word for it: Kerrisdale had some big wins, but it famously erred with Straight Path Communications, acquired by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) after a bidding war with AT&T (NYSE:T).That said, Kerrisdale's broad point still holds -- and the firm is not alone in making it. Several Wall Street analysts cut their targets after Koh's decision to adjust for the new risk. An antitrust loss will irrevocably change Qualcomm's business model, hurting both revenue and earnings. Investors can -- and will -- argue about the exact impact going forward, but there will be an impact. Can Qualcomm Win on Appeal?Of course, that assumes that Qualcomm winds up losing for good -- which is not guaranteed. Last week Koh refused a request to stay the decision. Qualcomm said in response that it will ask the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for an appeal, a process that could take a year or more on its own.And it's possible Qualcomm will win. More than a few legal experts have criticized Koh's logic. Most notably, an FTC Commissioner writing on her own behalf in the Wall Street Journal said the decision &quot;radically expanded a company's legal obligations to help its competitors.&quot; Even the Department of Justice has taken a notably different stance from its fellow regulatory agency.Other legal experts argue that Koh overreached. USC law professor Jonathan Barnett criticized the decision in an op-ed in The Hill on that basis. Barnett made a point echoed elsewhere: if Qualcomm's behavior was so anti-competitive, why have smartphone prices generally declined (at least outside of the iPhone)?It's exceedingly difficult to argue that end smartphone customers are somehow being deprived. Prices in many cases (particularly for Asian manufacturers) are declining. Innovation is proceeding at a breathtaking pace.Meanwhile, as others have pointed out, Apple -- the company likely most reliant on Qualcomm -- switched its baseband modem business to Intel. It's not Qualcomm's fault that effort failed. If anything, it highlights the fact that Qualcomm's R&D efforts are substantial -- and successful. It makes a better modem than Intel could. Should Qualcomm be punished for that? Where QCOM Sits NowIt's worth noting that, at the moment, QCOM stock sits only modestly below where it traded before Koh's decision was released. That doesn't necessarily mean that the market thinks the decision will be reversed.There has been good news elsewhere: The Huawei ban has been lifted, if partially. Chip stocks, helped recently by big earnings from Micron (NASDAQ:MU), have rallied.But there is a case that investors are being a little too sanguine relative to the antitrust risk. Qualcomm stock isn't necessarily expensive, at about 15x FY20 EPS estimates. Apple revenue should help growth beyond that as well. But 15x for a chip stock isn't cheap, even if a 3.2% dividend yield does help the case. INTC is at 11x CY20 EPS estimates, and AVGO at about 12x.Qualcomm stock is getting a premium -- and litigation risk aside, maybe it should. 5G is a bigger driver for Qualcomm than anything Intel has. Qualcomm has no competitors along the lines of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Broadcom thought Qualcomm was worth $82 per share -- and Qualcomm itself didn't believe that was enough. For the current business model, QCOM stock might be attractive at these levels (though it was more so at $65 just a few weeks ago). The Antitrust RiskTo own Qualcomm stock here, an investor has to have some faith that the antitrust case won't be a big deal. That seems too optimistic. It's easy to say that Microsoft weathered its own antitrust suit well, given that it is again heading toward a trillion-dollar market cap. But MSFT stock spent over a decade in the metaphorical desert after the resolution of its suit and the collapse of the dot-com boom.The FTC represents a very real threat to Qualcomm -- not just in terms of another potential fine. The business model that has cemented the company's dominance and driven some of the highest margins in the industry is at stake. Whatever the true financial impact of a permanent change would be, it will be significant. And investors, at the very least, need to understand that risk.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Of the S&P 500 components that have released preliminary data, 80% have slashed their earnings forecasts. Three tech giants, however, are looking upbeat, and forecasting good reports for the just-ended fiscal quarter. Weâve dipped into the TipRanks database to get the latest analyst reviews on the largest names in high-tech. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Microsoft, the old boy in the tech industry, has gained more than 34% so far this year, nearly doubling the S&P 500âs own brisk 18% pace. This rapid growth has put Microsoft in an exclusive club: it is only the third publicly traded company to break $1 trillion in total market cap, a milestone it reached in mid-June. Microsoft now has a valuation just under $1.06 trillion, ahead of Amazonâs (AMZN) $960 billion and Appleâs (AAPL) $920 billion.The companyâs success has come from solid performance in its various segments â legacy customers, Office 365, and Azure, combined with excitement over the upcoming public beta release of the new xCloud gaming service. Microsoft shows that a mega-cap company can combine the steady returns of a blue-chip stock with high-tech cutting-edge products and enthusiasm.Microsoft reports fiscal Q4 earnings on July 18, and the general view is that the company will justify its sky-high valuation. EPS is expected at $1.21, a 7% gain from the year-ago quarter, with revenues to come in at $32.75 billion, 8.8% over last yearâs Q4. While high, these gains represent a slowdown from Q3âs 14% growth, so any forecast beat will be welcomed by market watchers.Mark Moerdler, writing from Bernstein, sees the cloud bringing MSFT $140 billion in long-term sales, a solid foundation for further growth. He says, âMicrosoft has distinct advantages in portions of the market that should give the company the ability to reach, over time, revenue that is not that dissimilar to that of [Amazon Web Services].â Looking ahead to the future of cloud computing, Moerdler expects that Microsoft will emerge as one of two or three mega-cap companies dominating the sector. With that in mind, he gives MSFT a $152 price target and an 11% upside potential.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives describes Microsoftâs position for 2H19 and 2020 as âenviable,â saying that the company is âfiring on all cylinders around its Office 365 and Azure strategic vision.â Ives adds, âThe shift to cloud is a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting Microsoft in the field and should continue its momentum heading into the next 12-18 months.â With a price target of $155, he sees a 13% upside to MSFT.Microsoftâs analyst consensus rating is a strong buy; the company has 21 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell assigned in the last three months. The average price target is $144, with an upside of 5.14%. MSFT shares are selling for $136.View MSFT Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)At number two in total market cap, and the dominant player in online retail, Amazon is not worried about earnings, to be reported on July 25. The forecast calls for increases in both revenues and EPS. Revenues are predicted to come in 4.6% higher than last quarter, at $62.46 billion, while EPS is expected to show a higher gain, over 18%, with a bottom-line number of $5.58 per share. Last quarter, Amazonâs EPS of $7.09 represented a 35% beat of the forecast.Wall Streetâs top analysts are also confident of Amazonâs earnings success. From Cowen, John Blackledge gives the stock a $2,500 price target and 28% upside, saying, âThe companyâs move to Prime 1-day delivery will drive higher conversion rates, leading to increasing unit growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020.â He believes Prime 1-day has revenue potential of $1 billion to $2 billion this year.Barclays analyst Ross Sandler believes Amazon will report revenue acceleration in the fiscal second quarter. He says that, âthe combination of core retail picking up slightly earlier in Q2 and the extra 3%-4% to run-rate from next day shipping should take Amazon's growth rates up from Q1.â Accordingly, he keeps his buy rating on the stock, although his price target is a more modest $2.050Amazonâs overall rating, based on an analyst consensus of 35 buys and 1 hold, is a âStrong Buy.â The stock is selling for an eye-watering $1,956, so the average price target of $2,243 suggests an upside potential of 14%.View AMZN Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Like itâs mega-cap peers, Apple is looking at a strong quarterly report on July 30. The expected EPS is $2.10, slightly lower than last quarter, while revenues are forecast at a healthy $53.35 billion. Now that trade tensions between the US and China have eased, and the threat of further tariffs has faded for the present, Appleâs performance in the Chinese smartphone market remains the wildcard. iPhone holds a 9% to 10% market share in China; the earnings forecast is based on the Apple maintaining that niche.While Apple has been publicly shifting toward a model based on increased services, the iPhone remains the companyâs largest revenue generator. This is reflected in the analyst comments on the stock. Daniel Ives, quoted above regarding Microsoft, says that Wedbushâs recent market research âsuggests stable Apple iPhone demand globally heading into the crucial September quarter, that he would characterize as better than feared.â Ives gives Apple at price target of $235, suggesting 17% upside.Samik Chatterjee, of JPMorgan, describes is attitude toward Appleâs 2020 volume outlook for iPhone shipments as âincrementally positive.â He says, âGlobal supply chain and smartphone channel checks suggest that Apple is likely to pull an additional lever in the form of a refresh of the legacy iPhone SE/iPhone 8 model to address a value category.â He believes that next yearâs positive volume outlook will drive upgrades to meet consensus earnings expectations and boost AAPL shares. In line with this, he sees 2020 full year earnings hitting $13 and 2021 earnings reaching $15.30.Company guidance in the coming quarterly report will show if Chatterjeeâs estimates are in line. His price target, $239, indicates confidence in a 19% upside to the stock.AAPLâs âModerate Buyâ consensus rating is based on 19 buys, 14 holds, and 3 sells. Shares are priced at $200 with an average target of $216, an 8% upside for the stock.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailVisit TipRanksâ Stock Screener to find out more about the vital stats of these three stocks, and more.",2019-07-09,201.24,203.23,1.99,0.00988869,Don't move,17,85,1106,119,10.759493670886076

A weed leader and undisputed heavyweight champion of pot stocks, CGC stock was the very first cannabis company to list on the New York Stock Exchange and continues to be heavily traded in both Canada and the United States.Source: Shutterstock I suppose you could say it's the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of cannabis stocks, but does that necessarily make Canopy Growth stock the best pot stock pick? After all, CGC isn't exactly the cheapest one on the market, and you know the old saying: &quot;The bigger they are, the harder they fall.&quot; Can It Get Any Bigger?With a massive $4 billion capital infusion from alcoholic beverage mega-corporation Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), Canopy has more than enough capital and market share to dominate the Canadian weed space. While I can't predict exactly how Canopy will use those funds, I expect that the company may invest in the fast-growing edibles space as well as the international pot market as there are more than 30 countries currently pursuing a medical cannabis program.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe counter-argument among Canopy's critics is that a company of this size risks collapsing under its own weight. My reply is that just as the e-commerce space continues to grow (thus enabling Amazon to continue expanding), the global cannabis market has plenty of room to grow and Canopy Growth will, at least for the foreseeable future, have no shortage of new frontiers to conquer. Still the Revenue KingWhenever I evaluate a company, one of my prime directives is: &quot;Show me the revenues!&quot; In the case of Canopy Growth stock there's no shortage in that department, as the company's recently reported fourth-quarter (ending March 31) net revenues rose to $71.37 million from $20.14 million a year earlier.  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half Of course, it could be argued that Canopy's blockbuster revenue growth was driven by Canada's legalization of recreational cannabis -- and I won't dispute that this was a contributing factor. Nonetheless, a more-than-threefold increase in revenues in the span of a year isn't just the result of decriminalization: Canopy made a boatload of money during the past year, outpacing its competitors and vindicating Constellation's outsized investment. Several Steps AheadWith the cannabis market moving forward at a breakneck pace, companies must now innovate just to remain competitive. Much like Constellation demonstrated its forward-thinking mind-set by investing in Canopy, there's clear evidence that Canopy is also taking the necessary steps to maintain their bellwether position among weed firms.For instance, when the company acquired medicinal marijuana producers in South America and Africa last year, CGC showed its dedication to expansion far beyond the North American borders. Moreover, when Canopy made the commitment in April of this year to acquire American cannabis company Acreage Holdings Inc. for $3.4 billion (under the condition that the U.S. legalizes production and sale of cannabis), Canopy Growth proved to its shareholders that it's ready, willing and able to stake its claim on American soil.I tend to concur with Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett when he opines that Canopy Growth's purchase of the right to acquire Acreage is a &quot;big positive&quot; for the company. As I see it, Canopy is being highly proactive by not waiting for a federal ruling on marijuana law; the company's preparing for American domination, come what may. The Bottom Line on CGC StockPersonally, I'm not overly concerned about how expensive the CGC stock price is today, tomorrow or next week. I'm focusing more on the fundamentals than anything else -- and given the company's deep capital reserves and forward-thinking mind-set, I like Canopy stock for a long-term allocation at practically any price.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Koh concluded Wednesday thereâs no reason to halt the injunctions while the appeal is pending.Koh found that Qualcommâs âno license, no chipsâ policy unfairly leveraged the companyâs market position to force customers to pay inflated prices for chips and royalties for their technology. She ordered the company to end the policy and renegotiate some of its contracts for chips and royalties.Qualcomm said it will immediately ask San Franciscoâs federal appeals court to stay Kohâs May ruling.Qualcomm faced off with the FTC in an 11-day trial in January. Kohâs May ruling provided near blanket support for the FTCâs arguments. The decision not only raises uncertainty over the future of Qualcommâs business model, but it threatens to upend the smartphone industry now in the early stages releasing new 5G mobile technology worldwide.The order was a shock to Qualcomm and investors who expected a softer touch by Koh after the chipmaker and Apple Inc. struck a settlement in a similar lawsuit less than a month before her opinion. Instead, Koh described Qualcomm as having âstrangled competition...for yearsâ by requiring customers to pay licensing royalties when ordering new mobile phone chips.(Updates with judgeâs conclusion in second paragraph.

Apple has been under the cloud of this trade war for the last few months, with much of their production and supply chain based in China. Mnuchinâs said that a US/China trade deal was â90 percentâ complete, and he believes that âthereâs a path to complete thisâ at the G20 Summit in Japan this week when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet.Last week, Apple formally displayed its displeasure with the geopolitical situation when it formally asked the US government to not accelerate its tariffs on goods made in China. They also told the US Trade Representative that the governmentâs actions would hurt its global competitiveness. One month ago, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that there is a 29% downside risk to Appleâs earnings due to the possibility of the US/China trade war escalating further.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that Wall Street has priced in Appleâs worst-case scenario with this trade-war, and after these positive comments he maintains his Outperform rating on the stock, with a $235 price target. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)Ives believes that continued tariffs could reduce earnings by 10% to 15% over the next few years, but the seemingly strong possibility this overhang is removed is a fantastic sign for the tech giant and its investors.How much upside does Ives foresee in the stock if everything goes well? Ives thinks that âa resolution to the China tariff situation could add between $20-$25 per share to Apple's stock over the coming months.â This is due to the margin increases from the tariff reduction for phones sold in the US, and the significant importance of the Chinese market to Apple going forward with a saturated US market that has grinded iPhone sales growth to a standstill.Overall, AAPL stock had 15 bullish analysts in its corner over the last three months, 15 analysts playing it safe on the sidelines, and only two bears who think that the valuation on Apple stock is beyond crazy. The average price target on AAPL is $212.90, representing nearly 7% upside from where the stock is currently trading.To read more on the nitty gritty of whatâs going on in the tech stocks space, click here.Read more on AAPL:  * Apple (AAPL) Slowly Assembling Approach to Autonomy with Drive.ai  * Apple & Googleâs Vision of the Future Contrasted by Developer Resources  * Chinese Government Setting Tone of Support Towards Apple (AAPL)  * US-China Tensions Playing Stronger Role in Apple (AAPL) Stock  More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Micron (MU): Don't Pin Your Hopes on Japan-Korea Dispute, Says Deutsche Bank   * 3 âStrong Buyâ Biotech Stocks Ahead of FDA Verdicts   * 3 âStrong Buyâ Biotech Stocks Ahead of FDA Verdicts   * Adding Insurance to the Lineup May Help Tesla's Bottom Line Long-Term, Says Analyst",2019-06-28,197.92,201.55,3.63,0.018340744,Don't move,10,26,492,46,9.34959349593496

1469,3009,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightning-strikes-boeing-once-too-041338756.html?.tsrc=rss,Lightning Strikes Boeing Once Too Often,2019-06-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If youâre in the business of selling passenger aircraft, design flaws that might cause your planes to crash ought to be non-existent.Thatâs why the discovery of a second critical safety risk on Boeing Co.âs 737 Max is so alarming. Tests by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration found that flight computers could cause the plane to dive in a way that pilots struggled to correct in simulator tests, people familiar with the finding told Alan Levin and Julie Johnsson of Bloomberg News onÂ Wednesday. The problem wasnât connected to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, thatâs been linked to 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, but could produce similar effects, one of the people said.(1)Lightning shouldnât strike in the same place twice. Developing new aircraft is a decade-scale project, with certification byÂ aviation regulators alone typically taking five years. By the time a plane is ready to be delivered to customers, it should have passed through such a stringent battery of tests that only once-in-a-lifetimeÂ events can cause problems.Itâs bad enough that the 737 Max made it onto the market with one system that could cause uncontrolled flights to plunge into the ground. To discover a second casts a worrying light on the companyâsÂ entire safety culture.How could BoeingÂ have allowed further problems in such critical systems to lie undisclosed?Since the 737 Max grounding, many people, including this columnist, have exhorted the company to follow the crisis-management approach taken by Johnson & Johnson in the wake of the 1982 Tylenol scandal: PutÂ safety first and maximizeÂ transparency to convince the public that the company hasÂ nothing to hide.And yet, as my colleague Brooke Sutherland has argued, thereâs precious little evidence that Boeing has done enough in terms of improving transparency, communicationÂ and oversight to get it out of the doghouse.The problemÂ is that Boeing is a different sort of company thanÂ Johnson & Johnson. Consumers were easily able to choose another brand of painkillers if they didnât trust Tylenol, so winning back their trust was an existential issue. The same doesnât apply in the case of commercial aircraft, which are sold in a duopolistic market where any airline wanting to get a good price from Airbus SE has to keep Boeing in play as a potential supplier.In theory, passengers who refuse to fly on the 737 Max and find out at the departure gate that their aircraft has been switched from an A320neo could tear up their tickets and exercise consumer choice in the same way as a shopper buying headache pills. In practice, weâre all stuck with whatever is served up to us.Investors seem to know this. Boeingâs share price, amidÂ the grounding of its key productÂ and a simmering trade war over one of its biggest markets, is doing just fine. Blended forward 12-month price-earnings ratios put it on a higher valuation than Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Apple Inc. At the Paris airshow this month, the company managed to score a haul of around $34 billion in new orders âÂ less than the $44 billion tally for Airbus, to be sure, but grounded on a $24 billion commitment from IAG SA for the 737 Max itself.Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg this week promised to inspire a ârelentless pursuit of safetyâ at Boeing. âWe want to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable bringing problems to the surface,â he told the Aspen Ideas FestivalÂ on Wednesday. âWe donât want to create an environment where problems stay hidden.âThis latest revelation suggests thatâs still not happening âÂ and far from suffering, Boeing is doing just fine.Â (1) Slow processing by a cockpit chip meant that the workarounds pilots use to recover from problems with the MCAS were taking too long to kick in, according to a separate report by Aviation Week. Boeing acknowledged the issue and said itâs working on a software fix.To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has fined Google billions of dollars for antitrust violations and has opened an early-stage probe into Amazon.com Inc.âs potential use of data on smaller rivalsâ sales.âI wonât mention her name but sheâs actually considered to take Jean Claudeâs place because Jean Claude at some point is retiring,â said Trump, referring to the possibility that Vestager could succeed European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker. âShe hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person Iâve ever met. What she -- what she does to our country -- sheâs suing all our companies.âFor More: Faltering German Hands Vestager Chance to Claim Europeâs Top JobâYou know, look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, which perhaps we will, okay,â Trump said, without saying what he thinks the U.S. should sue the companies for. âTheyâre suing everybody, they make it very -- almost impossible to do two-way business.âAlphabet Inc.âs Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc. shares dipped on the news before recovering. Google was down 1.2%, Facebook fell less than 1% while Twitter gained 1.4% to Wednesday afternoon in New York.Representatives for Google and Facebook didnât comment.Social media companies have sought to more aggressively police their sites for what they consider hate speech and fraudulent accounts, but say they have no policies targeting conservatives.Trumpâs threat comes after Project Veritas, a conservative organization known for deceptively edited hidden-camera videos, released footage this week allegedly depicting a Google employee saying the company wants to prevent Trumpâs re-election.In a blog post, the woman from the video said the notion Google is trying to sway the election âis absolute, unadulterated nonsense.âShe said she was explaining that her former team at the company âis working to help prevent the types of online foreign interference that happened in 2016.âHouse HearingAll three companies were scheduled to testify before a House committee Wednesday on efforts to combat terrorist content and misinformation.Representative Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee holding the hearing said he had âserious questionsâ about Googleâs ability to be fair given the Project Veritas video.âThis report, and others like it, are a stark reminder of why the founders created the First Amendment,â Rogers said in his opening statement. âWe are in troubleâ if the views in the video represented Google company policy.Googleâs global director of information policy testified Wednesday that no single employee could skew search results based on her political beliefs.âWe are in the trust business,â the executive, Derek Slater, told Rogers. âWe have a long-term incentive to get that right.âBig technology companies are coming under heightened scrutiny in Washington from the government and Congress. Trumpâs Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have taken the first steps toward investigating four big platforms for antitrust violations by splitting jurisdiction over them. The Justice Department has taken responsibility for Google and Apple Inc., while the FTC will oversee Facebook and Amazon.The House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, led by Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, has launched a broad investigation into the nationâs biggest technology companies starting with a focus on how companies like Google and Facebook have impacted the news industry.For more: House Panel Kicks Off Antitrust Probe With Focus on News MediaSeparately, state attorneys general, including Nebraskaâs Doug Peterson and Louisianaâs Jeff Landry -- both Republicans -- are advancing a broad inquiry into whether the biggest U.S. technology platforms are violating antitrust and consumer protection statutes.(Updates with additional Trump quotes in seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from David McLaughlin.To contact the reporters on this story: Alyza Sebenius in Washington at asebenius@bloomberg.net;Ben Brody in Washington, D.C. at btenerellabr@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, ;Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-06-25,195.57,199.8,4.23,0.021629084,Buy,1,12,823,14,1.701093560145808

At ARM, Filippo was a lead engineer behind chip designs that power the vast majority of the worldâs smartphones and tablets and was leading a new push into parts for computers. ARM, owned by SoftBank Group Corp., designs microprocessors and licenses technology that is fundamental to the chip development efforts of Apple, Samsung Electronics Co., Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co.Prior to his work at ARM, Filippo was also a key designer at chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. ARM confirmed Filippoâs departure. Apple didnât respond to a request for comment.âMike was a long-time valuable member of the ARM community,â a spokesman for the U.K.-based company said. âWe appreciate all of his efforts and wish him well in his next endeavor.âFor Apple, the hire could help fill the void left by the departure of Gerard Williams III earlier this year. Williams was Appleâs head architect of chips used in the iPhone and iPad. Appleâs A series chips power its mobile devices using ARM technology. Its Mac computers have used processors from Intel for nearly two decades.The company initiated a plan several years ago to replace Intel chips in its Mac computers with processors based on the ARM architecture as early as 2020. Filippoâs experience in more advanced chips like those in servers would assist in that effort. The company is also planning to expand its in-house chip making work to new device categories like a headset that meshes augmented and virtual reality, Bloomberg News has reported.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comÂ©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",2019-06-25,195.57,199.8,4.23,0.021629084,Buy,6,3,345,15,4.3478260869565215

1497,3078,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-tech-weaker-looks-220006467.html?.tsrc=rss,Global Tech Is Weaker Than It Looks,2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ten months ago,Â I warned that storm clouds were brewing over the global technology industry. The situation today is much worse.Back then, a U.S.-China trade war was more risk than reality, Apple Inc.âs pending iPhone update held promise, and central banks were still in tightening mode. Yet inventories at the end of June 2018 had climbed to the highest since the financial crisis a decade earlier and a sector-wideÂ slowdown was looming.At the time, the Pollyannas were louder than the Chicken Littles. The next iPhone had yet to launch and Christmas shopping season was coming, argued the optimists.Since then, global technology companies have issued loud warnings aboutÂ lost sales due to U.S. actions against Huawei Technologies Inc.Â In short, because the U.S. is restricting what can be sold to the Chinese giant, the company and its suppliers are cutting orders. This is causing a ripple effect from semiconductor materials supplier IQE Plc to chip designer Broadcom Inc.But thereâs something you need to know about the Huawei effect:Â It isnâtÂ the cause of this technology recession. If anything, the company is the reason why the situation didnât worsen earlier. The U.S. war on Huawei propped up the tech sector, notably semiconductors, over the past year.Let me explain. Immediately after the Trump administration in May blacklisted HuaweiÂ from buying U.S. components, Bloomberg News reported that the maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones had been been stockpiling components in anticipation of some kind of action.Â Chairman Ren Zhengfei saw his own storm brewing and started saving for the rainy day that came on May 17.This tells us that some proportion of global component demand over the past year wasnât led by end-product sales, but merely by shelf-stocking. More significantly, what revenue component makers did see was probablyÂ a false signal, pointing to demand that didnât exist.These suspicions were confirmed earlier this month when Mark Liu, chairman of made-to-order chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., told me that he wasnât sure how much of his company's recent revenue had gone toÂ supplying Huaweiâs end-product demand versus buildingÂ the Chinese companyâs inventory. Almost every technology company is a client of TSMC.Â If Liu,Â who has the broadest and deepest picture of the global tech sector,Â canât make out the difference between demand and inventory build, then you can be sure heâs not alone.Thereâs also solid data to show the scale of HuaweiâsÂ stockpiling. Total inventories climbed 33% last year. ItsÂ stash of components âÂ measured as raw materials and works in progress â jumped 76%. At even its most optimistic, thereâs no way that Huawei expected 76% revenue growth this year.Which brings us back to the sector as a whole.Hereâs an update of the numbers compiled 10 months ago, based on nine leading technology hardware companies and charted by my colleague Elaine He.Â The results arenât heartening:With few exceptions, inventories âÂ measured in dollar terms or days outstanding âÂ climbed since June 30, 2018, and were unequivocally higher than two years ago. The revenue slowdowns that have affected every corner of the hardware sector this year make this buildup ominous.Of even greater concern areÂ data pointing to prolonged cash conversion cycles, a measure of how long companies take to turn manufactured goods into money. The only firm to see a solid dip is Apple, and thatâs because it tends to generate revenue from customers before having to pay suppliers.Â Both TSMCÂ and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (aka Foxconn) have said they hold inventory on their books for theirÂ key client.Â Were it not for that fact, Appleâs rising inventory days outstanding would probably be even higher.A major reason for Hon Hai posting weak earnings in the first quarter was inventory provisions. Those can be reversed if products sitting on shelves get sold to consumers, Hon Hai CFO David Huang told me this month. But shipping an already-made device to meet demand means you donât need to manufacture a new phone, which in turn means no need to buy components from suppliers, and so forth.Thatâs the situation weâre in now: plenty of inventory, false signals from the Huawei effect, and a pending global economic slowdown thatâs likely to suppress demand. If that doesnât make make you worry about the state of global technology hardware, then I applaud your optimism.Â To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1502,3083,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/internet-everywhere-internet-jobs-aren-130006652.html?.tsrc=rss,"The Internet Is Everywhere, But Internet Jobs Arenât",2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The internet was supposed to render geography irrelevant.(2)Â But the corporations that dominate the internet have turned out to be remarkably concentrated, geographically speaking. In internet publishing and web search portals, a somewhat ungainly but very important North American Industry Classification SystemÂ category, 58% of all U.S. jobs in December could be found in just fiveÂ counties, and more than 70% in the top 10.The location quotient is a measure of how concentrated an industry is in a particular place â a quotient of 1 means itâs right at the national average âÂ and the location quotients in the above tableÂ make clear that this particular industry is heavily concentrated in the top five counties, especially the three borderingÂ San Francisco Bay. In San Mateo County, home of Facebook Inc., one is about 30 times more likely to encounter an internet publishing and web search portal employee than in the country in general. Just to the south in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley and the home ofÂ Google and its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., itâs 27 times more likely. Just to the north in San Francisco County, home of Twitter Inc. and Pinterest Inc., itâs 13 times more likely.Â The Bureau of Labor Statistics actually didnât release fourth-quarter San Mateo County data for the sector, presumably because it was so dominated by Facebook that this would amount to disclosing private information, so I backed out the numbers using metropolitan-area data and a little elbow grease. The BLS did release San Mateo County numbers for the third quarter, and the employment total and location quotient were close to those I came up with (the average weekly wage was higher, at $8,872), so I donât think this was much of a stretch.Related:Â Where Microbrewery Jobs Are OverflowingFinancial Jobs Arenât Just in New YorkA Booming Local Health-Care Industry Isnât Always a Good ThingEmployment location quotients of 30 and 27 are, it should be stressed, quite high, especially for such populous counties (San Mateo County has about 770,000 inhabitants; Santa Clara County nearly 2 million). Wayne County, Michigan, theÂ headquarters of the U.S. automobile industry, had a December employment location quotient for motor vehicle manufacturingÂ of 16.7; the District of Columbiaâs location quotient for federal government employment was 13 and change.Santa Clara CountyÂ did have a dizzying December location quotient of almost 64 forÂ electronic computer manufacturing (thanks mainly, one assumes, to Cupertino-based Apple Inc.)Â and 40 for semiconductor machinery manufacturing (industry leader Applied Materials Inc. is based in the city of Santa Clara), but those are at least industries that revolve aroundÂ creating complex, tangible products, which it stands to reason necessitates lots of people working in the same place. The internet is on first impression different: Itâs everywhere, and it can be worked on from anywhere. Yet employment at the corporations thatÂ shape it is concentrated in a handful of places in the U.S.Â and has been getting more so.Â In March 2014, the top five counties accounted for 48% of the nationâs internet publishing and web search portal jobs, and the top 10 62%.Facebook and Google have been expanding overseas, so itâs possible that this focus on U.S. data is somewhatÂ misleading â sadly thereâs no global counterpart to the hyper-detailed Quarterly Census of Employment and WagesÂ from which the data in this column (as well as pieces over the past few days on breweries, financial services and health care) is taken. Also, itâs not all about engineers at Facebook and Google: As the lower average wages outside of Silicon Valley indicate, this category also includes journalists working at online enterprises such as BuzzFeed Inc. and Vox Media Inc. in New York and elsewhere. It may also include contract workers slowly going crazy moderating Facebook pages in Phoenix;Â itâs often hard to know for sure how specific corporate activities are classified by the BLS, because the BLS isnât allowed to say, but the goal is to assign the people working at a location to the industry sector that best fits what most of them areÂ working on.Traditional media has a tendency toward concentration, too: Los Angeles County has 27% of the nationâs jobs inÂ motion picture and sound recording industries. New York County (aka Manhattan) has 18% of all U.S. periodicals publishing jobs. The two counties together account for 20% of broadcasting employment. But the top-five and top-10 countiesâ shares of jobs in these sectors areÂ much smaller than with internet publishing and web search portals, and in motion pictures and periodicals, the very top counties have actuallyÂ been losing employment share in recent years asÂ media companies shift production to less expensive locales.In their much-cited 2009 review of what drives economic activity and the resulting wealth to âagglomerateâ in certain cities, economists Edward Glaeser and Joshua Gottlieb wrote that:The largest body of evidence supports the view that cities succeed by spurring the transfer of information. Skilled industries are more likely to locate in urban areas and skills predict urban success. Workers have steeper age-earnings profiles in cities and city-level human capital strongly predicts income. It is possible that these effects will be reduced by ongoing improvements in information technology, but that is not certain and has not happened yet.Itâs presumably the value of this transfer of information among skilled workers that has driven internet companies to concentrate in a few places. High costs in those places and those âongoing improvements in information technologyâ might drive dispersion, although thereâs no sign of that yet in this data. Politics might, too: As Facebook in particular has been discovering lately, having your employees concentrated in a few places can mean having few friends in Washington. But for now, the work of internet publishing and web search portals remains tightly clustered along the San Francisco Bay, and to a lesser extent the Hudson River and Puget Sound. Geography still seems to matter, a lot.Coming Tuesday: the sectors with the highest location quotients.(1) I realize that this has become something of a straw man, and that by this point far more has been written attacking the idea that the internet renders geography irrelevant than espousing it. But as someone who was at least halfway paying attention in the 1990s, I think it's fair to say that most people in those days assumed that universal connectivity would lead to a spreading out of economic activity rather than a concentration.To contact the author of this story: Justin Fox at justinfox@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brooke Sample at bsample1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

1507,3088,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitter-contest-china-online-shoppers-065559774.html?.tsrc=rss,The Bitter Contest for Chinaâs Online Shoppers,2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Carrefour SA,Â Europe's largest retailer,Â  may be the latest Western company to pull back from China.Â Itâs unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the hypermarket operatorÂ said it would sell 80% of its China business for 4.8 billion yuan ($699 million) in cash to Suning.com, theÂ Chinese retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Carrefour will retain a 20% stake.Â Over the past few years,Â the French companyâs plans to shrink its China footprint has been one of the worst-kept secrets in banking. Though Carrefour sold the business pretty cheaply â with a valuation of 0.2 times 2018 sales, compared with the industry average of 0.84, according to Citigroup Inc. â loosening its ties to the mainland may be a smart move, whatever the price. WithÂ sales in the country flaggingÂ and losses piling up, the deal comes as Chinaâs macroeconomic picture is also darkening.Yet the key challenge for Carrefour preceded the trade war. In recent years, online-only players such as Alibaba have been piling pressure on brick-and-mortar operations, with Tesco Plc, Best Buy Co. and Marks & Spencer PlcÂ each announcing plans to pull back from the mainland market. Carrefourâs share of the countryâs hypermarket segment fell to 4.6% last year from 8.2% in 2009, Citi writes.(1)Â  Â Thatâs a problem in a country withÂ one of the worldâs biggest rates ofÂ e-commerce penetration.Â China's online retail sales reached 3.86 trillion yuanÂ in the first five months of this year, accounting for more than one-fifth of the country's total purchases of consumer goods, according to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Â To make matters worse, foreign brands no longer have the cachet they once enjoyed â at least in low-end consumer goods. In a survey last year, Credit Suisse AG said that Chinese consumers preferred domestic purveyors in categories like food and drinks and home appliances. With the trade war whipping up nationalist fervor, that trend may accelerate: The bank's latest poll of shoppers 18 to 29 years old showed that 41% preferred phones made by Huawei Technologies Co., up from 28%, while interest for Apple Inc.âs products fell to 28% from 40%.For many firms, ceding control to a local partner is probably the best way forward. Carrefour appears to be borrowing a page from the playbook of McDonaldâs Corp., which sold 80% of its China business in 2017 to a tie-up between state giant Citic Group Corp. and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP.Or consider Walmart Inc., which sold its e-commerce delivery site to JD.com Inc. in 2016 in exchange for a stake in the Chinese retailer. The U.S. firm now aims to open 40 of its Samâs Club stores in China by 2020. Costco Wholesale Corp. is also betting on Chinaâs appetite for bulk buying, with plans toÂ open its first bricks-and-mortar storeÂ in August. Whether Costco can pull this off without a local partner remains unclear.What is clear is that Carrefour wonât be the last retailer to rethink its China strategy. Germany's Metro AG is also looking to sell its $1.5 billion Chinese business. At a time when Chinese acquisitions overseas have dried up, bankers at least can thank Western firms for managing to drum up some business from the mainland.Â (1) The bank citesEuromonitor International research.To contact the author of this story: Nisha Gopalan at ngopalan3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Rachel Rosenthal at rrosenthal21@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

There was some bullish analyst chatter on Apple stock yesterday along with rumors that the company is considering an acquisition to bolster its footprint in the fast-growing autonomous vehicle market.Outside of tech, United HealthGroup (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare stock in the Dow and one of the index's worst-performing components this year, enjoyed a decent day Friday, gaining 2.05% to put a dent into a year-to-date loss of almost 3%. On Thursday, UnitedHealth declared a quarterly dividend of $1.08 per share, up from the previous quarter's payout of 90 cents a share.McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continued its assault on the record books, hitting another all-time high after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the fast food giant with a $220 price target, implying decent upside from Friday's close around $206.&quot;The company has generated strong growth in international markets, and though its traffic has been down in the U.S., its same-store sales have easily outperformed competitors as customers pay higher prices and order more add-ons,&quot; according to Restaurant Business. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHeading into Friday, it was expected that the May jobs report would miss expectations and do so in a big way. Still, it is encouraging to see riskier assets, such as stocks, handle that number with aplomb. There is still plenty of June, but the Dow closed the first week of a month that is historically rough on stocks on a four-day winning streak.Traders likely bid stocks higher today because the weak jobs number stoked hope that if the economy slows, the Federal Reserve could step in with interest rate cuts. In fact, bond markets are now pricing in as many as three rate cuts this year, with one possibly coming as soon as next month.It remains to be seen whether or not the Fed will pursue any rate cuts this year, so monitoring President Trump's Twitter feed for trade updates may help investors get a sense for where stocks are headed next week.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

A number of stocks surged higher on the day, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones climbing more than 1% and the Nasdaq running as high as 2% before the close. The move comes off a less-than-stellar jobs report, as investors' hopes for further rate cuts fuel stock prices higher. Let's look at some top stock trades ahead of next week. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Amazon  Click to EnlargeShares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are showing a nice lift on Friday, up 2.6%. In fact, other large cap companies are too, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also moving nicely. Interestingly, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is not, which we'll get to in a moment.That $1,700 breakout level we were watching held for the most part this week. We've quickly seen a $100 rally in AMZN, as the market has been surging over the past few day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Shares are now running into downtrend resistance and the 20-day moving average. A push through this level could trigger a run to the 50-day. Should it act as resistance, I want to see if the 200-day moving average acts as support. If it does, AMZN will form a higher low, a bullish technical development. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Alphabet  Click to EnlargeGOOGL on the other hand, hasn't been acting so well. While it finally took out this week's highs on Friday, it's not doing so in convincing fashion. Consider how strong the Nasdaq has been all week, and short of Friday, how pathetic GOOGL stock has been trading.Now into the gap though and perhaps this one can gain some upside momentum. If downtrend resistance doesn't knock it back down, I want to see if Alphabet can fill the gap up to $1,100.Should GOOGL lose Monday's opening levels near $1,065, then the $1,035-ish lows are back on the table. Shares flirted with these lows all week and ultimately found buyers each time. Below here could get us a dip down to $1,000.If the markets fade next week, GOOGL may too. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Beyond Meat  Click to EnlargeOne of the market's biggest fascinations right now is Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), which is up 36% on better-than-expected earnings. However, don't be fooled. While this name can continue higher, it's mainly due to the very low share count currently available for trade as it's a recent IPO.Currently floating at new highs, BYND can continue higher if buyers keep pushing it. On a pullback, see if prior channel resistance near $120 can support it.If not, a pullback to $105 may be in order, which is prior range resistance. Below that and $95 is on the table, with the 38.2% retracement near $93. Further, the upward trending 20-day moving average is just below around $92. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: FedEx  Click to EnlargeHow ugly has FedEx (NYSE:FDX) been? Answer: Very.FedEx was in the news on Friday after it opted not to renew its Express U.S. service with Amazon.If we're giving FedEx the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; treatment, we can say that it already broke out of downtrend resistance (thin purple line). However, I have FDX in the &quot;prove it&quot; camp instead, because it's chart has been so dreadful. Therefore in my eyes, shares are still stuck in a downtrend (thick purple line).The stock has put in a double bottom at $150 and its MACD (blue circle) indicates that bulls are gaining momentum.Yet FDX just has too many trends going from the upper left to the lower right. Over downtrend resistance gets us to the 20-day. Over that gets us to $170, which I expect to act as resistance. At least on the first test.If $150 breaks to the downside, FDX is in no man's land. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Docusign  Click to EnlargeI covered Docusign's (NASDAQ:DOCU) earnings plunge, arguing that the selloff seems like an overreaction.Below key support between $50 and $52, as well as the 61.8% retracement at $47.78, and we said it was possible for DOCU stock to drop into the $45 area. On the plus side, it didn't have to go quite that low to find buyers. Even better, it reclaimed the 61.8% mark.So now what?I would love to see DOCU stock reclaim the $50 mark and its 200-day moving average. If it can, perhaps it can fight back into its prior range and give its 50-day moving average a test. Whether it gets that high or not doesn't really matter though, because it would be really bullish to see DOCU selloff this hard and quickly reclaim key support.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% On the downside, I want to see how Docusign reacts to $44 to $45 should it decline next week. If buyers can't buoy it, sub-$40 could be in the cards.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

It's true.Source: Shutterstock The SEC, operating under the Reagan Republicans, passed rule 10b-18, which made stock buybacks legal. Up until the passing of this rule, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 considered large-scale share repurchases a form of stock manipulation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe 1982 rule provided &quot;safe harbor&quot; protection as long as a company bought back no more than 25% of its average daily volume over the previous four weeks and didn't buy its stock at the beginning or end of the day's trading. The SEC Commissioners argued at the time that the rule would encourage higher stock prices thereby benefiting investors across the board.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Care to guess who the SEC Chairman was in 1982? John Shad. John Shad was a former executive with E.F. Hutton. It seems odd that someone who worked for a company that directly benefited from the rule change (higher prices equals higher commissions) would be in charge of the agency created to protect investors. In hindsight, it seems like a massive conflict of interest, but I digress.The reality is that stock buybacks have helped the wealthiest 1% get even richer over the past 36 years. In 1982, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the average CEO earned 50 times the average production worker. Today, the CEO Pay Ratio's increased to 144 times the average worker with most of the gains a result of stock options and awards. Suggesting stock buybacks ought to be illegal isn't a crazy notion. Here are seven reasons why: Stock Buybacks Reward a Lack of Creativity and InnovationBy mid-December of 2018 following the corporate tax cut that was supposed to help the middle class, America's public companies had announced $1.1 trillion in stock buybacks with $800 billion already repurchased with only two weeks left in 2018. A record year by any standard.  Source: Shutterstock On the one hand, buybacks of this size make sense in a year that saw many stocks lose ground. On the other, 2018 was the first year of negative returns for the S&P 500 since 2008, making the latest bull market one of the longest in history.  In the eyes of many, stocks are overvalued, despite their retreat in 2018.Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ought to have better things to do with their cash than buying back billions of dollars in stock. It stifles creativity and innovation, something Apple's going to need if it wants to keep growing. &quot;I find it absolutely mind-numbing that a company like Apple can sit on $260 billion of cash,&quot; Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko told CNN recently. &quot;You're telling me that all these genius people can't think of one intelligent thing to do with that capital?&quot;  I'm a fan of Tim Cook and Apple, but stock buybacks are not the answer to the company's slowing innovation. Stock Buybacks Hurt the U.S. EconomyThis argument is a rather circuitous one so bear with me.CNN recently reported that America's total debt is nearly $22 trillion, an average of $67,000 per person. That's right; split between all U.S. citizens, you'd owe $67,000 for your share of America's debt. In 2019, America's bill for the interest on that debt is $383 billion; by 2025 it's projected to hit $928 billion or about the same amount as corporate stock buybacks in 2018. Imagine if the dollars directed to share repurchases were redirected to paying down the national debt. At the current pace of stock buybacks, the debt problem could be eliminated in 22 years. But of course, that wouldn't help the wealthiest 1%.Consider this: Many economists argued that the Trump tax cuts would worsen the debt situation and they were right. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Trump tax cuts would add $1.9 trillion in principal and interest to the deficit by 2027. Since Trump's become President, the national debt's increased by more than $2 trillion. Thus, the president and Congress face a difficult decision.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Increase taxes, cut spending or do a combination of both. Do nothing, and the deficit continues to increase, and the U.S. dollar risks becoming irrelevant on a global scale as its creditworthiness crumbles.Trump's plan was simple: Cut corporate taxes and the savings will be reinvested. The $1.1 trillion in stock buybacks in 2018 suggests that didn't happen. God help the common man if we go into recession in the next two years because there will be nothing available to reignite the economy. The cupboards will be bare.  Stock Buybacks Add to DebtloadThe previous reason why stock buybacks ought to be illegal had to do with the federal government's mishandling of an economy on the rise. I never thought the corporate tax cuts were a good idea.&quot;America's crumbling infrastructure isn't going to be fixed when the federal government's revenues are going the wrong way. President Donald Trump promised an infrastructure plan, but with lower revenues expected over the next decade, it will be tough for him to deliver,&quot; I wrote in December 2017. &quot;And don't for a minute expect private businesses to jump into the fight to save the day with their new-found wealth.&quot;They haven't. And won't. So, here we have a federal government drowning in debt, encouraging public companies to do the same through stock buybacks. Unfortunately, as bond guru Jeffrey Gundlach suggests, increasing stock buybacks reduces the solidity of a company's balance sheet. &quot;So, the balance sheets of corporations are balanced on ever-dwindling equities as they buy back shares and increase their leverage ratios. And that's not good,&quot; Gundlach stated in January. &quot;Strong balance sheets are going to be the way to survive during the zigzag of 2019.&quot;In Gundlach's estimation, strong balance sheets are far more critical than strong earnings.With 62% of investment grade debt maturing over the next five years, there are a lot of companies that are going to wish they didn't buy back so much stock.Stock Buybacks Reduce Capital SpendingAll businesses have one cash flow bucket. Cash goes in; cash goes out, the difference is the capital it can allocate for uses other than keeping the company running. These uses include debt repayment, dividends, stock buybacks, acquisitions, and investing in the future.Source: Shutterstock The Trump corporate tax cut was intended to put more money in corporate coffers so they could invest in the future creating more jobs. While the unemployment rate is healthier than it's ever been, it's unlikely that it was the result of increased capital spending. In the last two years of the Obama administration, five million jobs were created while 4.8 million were created in the first two years of Trump's presidency, suggesting that almost any economic strategy would have worked for the incoming president. According to Just Capital, 56% of the tax savings from the new corporate tax rate went to shareholders with just 24% allocated to wages and job creation. Just 8% went to improving products and innovating, and the remainder went to lower prices and community involvement. In 2018, the bucket spilled over for stock buybacks. Capital spending, not so much. Stock Buybacks Provide a False PictureThe main argument for stock buybacks is that the reduction in shares outstanding increases earnings per share which is the primary driver of higher share prices. A secondary consideration is that every shareholder gets a more significant piece of a smaller pie.It's no wonder, then, that Warren Buffett's a big fan of stock buybacks. Every time a company held by Buffett announces a $10 billion share repurchase program, he rubs his hands with glee because his ownership stake goes up without making an additional investment. It's the power of compounding in reverse. In 2014, I wrote an article entitled The 2 Biggest Lies of Buybacks. One paragraph sticks out for me to this day. &quot;The premise that buybacks boost earnings is a big fat lie. It's an optical illusion meant to distract investors from the truth: Bottom-line growth is measured by net income only and not earnings per share,&quot; I wrote in 2014. &quot;After all, you wouldn't judge top-line growth by anything other than revenue, would you?&quot;In the article, I used Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as an example of how buybacks hide the truth. Because it bought back 4.4 billion shares between 2009 and 2013, while its net earnings were down 28% that year, EPS were down a more palatable 15%. You can argue till the cows come home why I'm wrong, but a 28% decline is a 28% decline, no matter how many shares are outstanding. Stock Buybacks Create Income InequalityAs I pointed out in a previous slide, the period between 1982-2017 has created a much wider gap between the person at the top of the pyramid, the CEO, and the workers on the bottom.According to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, CEO pay between 1990 and 2016 increased by 438%. Meanwhile, according to the Pew Research Center, the average seasonally adjusted hourly wage in the U.S. between 1964 and 2018 grew by just 12% in constant 2018 dollars. The legalization of stock buybacks in 1982 gave CEOs a massive incentive for repurchasing their company's shares. Their pay packages went through the roof while the rank-and-file employees saw their wages barely budge. A rational person would see the causal link when it comes to income inequality. CEOs Love Stock BuybacksHey, if you're a CEO, I wouldn't blame you for taking advantage of the system. It's not your fault that the board of directors gave you such a lucrative compensation package. After all, they didn't have to. It's not as if you were holding a gun to their heads.Source: FlickrWho wouldn't like a pay package that grows and grows and grows without any additional effort? As a writer, I'd love to be able to get paid X dollars to write this article today, X dollars plus next year, and X dollars plus, plus, the year after that. It is not going to happen. But it happens every day for CEOs. Is it any wonder why they love stock buybacks?Let's take Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) for example.In fiscal 2018, it repurchased 279 million shares of its stock for $22.6 billion. That alone would have a material effect on earnings per share, which is a significant factor in Qualcomm's annual cash incentive plan, as well as a considerable influence on both its performance stock unit and restricted stock unit awards. In fiscal 2018, CEO Steve Mollenkopf received total compensation of $20.0 million. The year before that it was $11.6 million and $11.1 million in fiscal 2016. Of Mollenkopf's total compensation, 86% was EPS-related to one extent or another. Do you think he's got an incentive to repurchase Qualcomm shares? I sure do.

But when it comes to financial giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), on and off the price chart JPM stock is a buy and BAC stock is where you go to buy a Certificate of Deposit. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Buying a couple, or even a few, names within an area such as technology to reduce portfolio risk can make a great deal of sense. There is, of course, a big difference between owning a company like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and having exposure in another tech outfit such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).But for bank stocks like JPMorgan and Bank of America, there's simply too much redundancy to believe the power of diversification is a truly attractive strategy. In general, JPM and BAC stock will travel more or less in the same direction depending on various macro influences impacting the country's first and second largest banks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis view also means going long JPM stock and shorting BAC shares, without solid company-specific cause and similar to what we've seen the past couple years in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) or Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) probably isn't going to yield much as an investment play either.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets And when it comes to the price lines that investors use to gauge one company against another, in today's market JPM stock is a buy, while Bank of America is only good for locking in less bang for the buck. Bank Stock Buy: JPM StockOff the price chart, JPM stock, the country's largest bank by assets, continues to make all the right moves. In early April, the company easily topped profit and sales views. JPMorgan's report also offered investors broad-based growth in numerous units ranging from its loan portfolio business, credit card sales and advisory revenue to debt underwriting and surging investment banking sales, which hit all-time-highs.On the price chart, JPM stock is firing on all cylinders -- or as well as can be expected given the recent market hostilities tied to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.The weekly chart shows that by the end of April, after two separate corrective phases since early 2018, JPM stock had narrowly notched a higher all-time-high. The chart also shows during this past month's broad-based pullback that JPMorgan has put together a constructive higher low pivot to confirm the banker's uptrend.With the weekly candle pivot low receiving modest trade-through confirmation to the upside on Tuesday and JPM's stochastics beginning to turn higher in neutral territory, an investment in JPM stock looks good. But it looks even better on the daily chart.Tuesday's weekly confirmation also managed to reverse JPM stock's breach of its 200-day simple moving average. Given the well-watched technical level also lines up nicely with a price fill of JPM's earnings-driven price gap and test of the 38% retracement level--it's time to invest in this best of breed stock today. Bank Stock Hold: BAC StockOff the price chart BAC stock, the United States' second-biggest bank, delivered mixed results in its quarterly confessional back in mid-April. Bank of America managed to top and grow profit estimates by a slight margin, but sales narrowly missed views while also dropping from theAnd on the price chart, unlike JPM stock, the big picture is also a mixed bag for BAC stock investors.I like the weekly BAC stock chart for its Bollinger Band support, oversold stochastics and test of the 50% Fibonacci level. But I think we can all agree, along with the lower high pattern, BAC stock's price action is weaker and definitely earns it the number two spot here as well.BAC stock's daily price chart also paints a more precarious picture. Unlike JPM stock, we can see that while shares managed to score a new high for 2019, by the end of April, BAC is well beneath its earnings levels and in a testing position of 200-day simple moving average resistance. Regardless of what the Fed says later this month or what happens with the trade war, BAC stock doesn't look strong enough on its own merit to buy shares right now.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple had the third-most autonomous miles driven in that state in 2018, but struggled with disengagements, with human drivers having to take control back from the car about once every mile.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.65% while the S&P 500 climbed 2.14%.Source: Shutterstock After nudging higher yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.06% on Tuesday. Stocks were bolstered Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Chicago conference that the central bank is keeping close tabs on the trade war and that it &quot;will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion&quot; if the trade conflict harms the U.S. economy.While Powell added the Fed is not considering negative interest rates, there is increasing speculation in the financial community that the central bank could consider lowering interest rates, perhaps doing so as soon as later this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Important LeadershipIn late trading, nearly all of the Dow Jones's components were higher on the day and the blue-chip index was receiving some support from some marquee names, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). A day after big tech stocks, including Apple, were stung by news that the Justice Department is considering looking into anti-trust issues at some of the largest U.S.-based firms, shares of the iPad maker jumped 3.66%.  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge California-based Apple is conducting its worldwide developers conference, and analysts now appear enthusiastic about the company's emphasis on privacy protocols.&quot;The analysts were particularly intrigued by Apple's focus on features related to data privacy, which not accidentally stands in contrast with the growing view that the social-media giants don't take the issue seriously,&quot; reports Barron's.Nike (NYSE:NKE) was another big Dow winner on Tuesday, rising 4.69% despite news out yesterday that Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard filed a lawsuit against the athletic apparel giant over use of a logo he believes he owns the rights to.&quot;Leonard claims that he developed the logo himself by tracing his very large hands,&quot; according to the Associated Press. &quot;The ring and pinky fingers of the logo are shaped into a 'K,' the middle finger and thumb form an 'L' and the index finger is designed to resemble an elongated '2' -- all nods to his initials and jersey number.&quot;Leonard, whose Raptors are playing the Golden State Warriors for the NBA championship, was a Nike endorser until 2018. He now endorses New Balance sneakers.Shares of embattled aerospace and defense behemoth Boeing (NYSE:BA), the largest member of the price-weighted Dow, closed higher Tuesday after UBS analyst Myles Watson published research indicating that while air travelers are still expressing concern about the safety of Boeing's 737 MAX jet, the issue can be overcome by the company.The good news in Watson's research: &quot;almost 89% of respondents who are worried about the 737 MAX said fears would subside after six months of safe operation,&quot; according to Barron's. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayMarkets have been sagging due in large part to the White House's insistence on a multi-front trade war, so all it took was a glimmer of positive thinking to ignite a rally on Tuesday. That glimmer came courtesy of dovish comments by the Fed.Translation: the trade war issue has not gone away. If anything, it could intensify as President Donald Trump continues lobbing harsh rhetoric at Mexico. Still, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters Tuesday that he believes the two sides can reach a trade truce. Obrador made those remarks even after Trump threatened more tariffs on goods imported from Mexico, the largest trading partner of the U.S.Again, Tuesday is just one day, but it could be a positive sign that the only two sectors in the red for the day were the defensive real estate and utilities groups. Those sectors are not represented in the Dow and are among the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

But Twitter stock could be a good way to avoid the current, overwhelming problem of market volatility.Source: Shutterstock That's a tough pill for some investors to digest. Against a backdrop of a brutal trade war and in an environment in which Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have somehow settled their legal spat even as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is actually asking for privacy regulation, clearly nothing is etched in stone.With all of its glorious, gimmick-free simplicity though, Twitter is the market's proverbial breath of fresh air that not too many traders are noticing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth  Off the RadarTwitter is not Facebook, a nuance that's been pointed out countless times since Twitter's launch in 2006. It's simplistic, lacking many of the vanity-minded features Facebook offers.TWTR is also less potent as an advertising platform. Twitter's average revenue per user is a little more than a third of Facebook's, and it has only a fraction of Facebook's regular user base. Twitter can't benefit from being big because it's not that large.As it turns out, however, perhaps Twitter's slightly less sophisticated i.e.  less invasive, approach of getting to know its users has been a blessing in disguise.That's not to suggest the company has remained completely free of controversy. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was rather well-grilled by a Senate committee late last year, and Twitter was investigated for potential violations of the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules shortly thereafter.But Senators' questions were focused more on censorship and less on privacy practices, and there's little doubt that the EU has been far more concerned with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) breadwinner Google and Facebook than it has been with Twitter.Google and Facebook make for much juicier targets, while Twitter is relatively benign, so Twitter stock doesn't face much of a regulatory headwind compared with other digital-ad stocks. Twitter Stock Price to Be Boosted by More Steady Growth AheadTwitter has sought to serve as an interactive, television-delivery platform, with an emphasis on sports programming. It partners with the NFL, but also works with ESPN . Last year, the platform also made it radically easier for users to find and engage in discussions that are of most interest to them.None of these platform improvements are exactly new though. They are tweaks that have been going on for years, so slowly that few observers have noticed.Long-term owners of Twitter stock have surely noticed, however, that the new M.O. not only works, but that Twitter has avoided the regulatory and media pressure that bigger players like Google and Facebook are enduring. As a result, TWTR has had a solid streak of revenue growth that's translating into similar earnings growth. Analysts expect more of the same for the foreseeable future.The  double-digit growth is sustainable simply because the company's business model isn't under attack the way Facebook's is. Indirect rival Google is also setting itself up for a step backwards, recently unveiling a way for users to delete a big chunk of their life that the tech giant regularly monitors. Ads shown to those users should, as a result, theoretically be less targeted, and therefore less effective.Twitter isn't being forced to take such disruptive actions. The Bottom Line on Twitter StockThough Twitter's top and bottom lines are more secure in this privacy-minded era than those of its competitors, it would be naive to think Twitter stock is equally well-shielded from volatility. Most stocks tend to ebb and flow with the tide of the stock market.For the right company though, bearish tides hurt a little less, and bullish tides help a little more.And, if the market's turbulence lasts long enough, raw financial results will eventually remind investors that TWTR stock is something of a standout, simply by virtue of sidestepping all the landmines too many other organizations have stepped on of late.Hopefully proving its mettle in this way won't be necessary, but given this week's market-wide trouble, that may be something the company is called on to do. Twitter stock price should pass that stability/predictability test with flying colors.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Alphabet.

These larger, more established companies have their own voice assistants, their own music hardware and their own systems becoming directly integrated into vehicle entertainment systems. After months of rumors, SPOT announced that it is taking a step toward building its own hardware, starting with the automobile. The Spotify Car Thing has broken cover, a voice-controlled device with one purpose: to play Spotify music while driving.Source: Spotify  Spotify Joins Streaming Music Rivals in the CarAmong the top four streaming music services (by paid subscribers), Spotify is currently the only one that doesn't offer its own hardware solution for vehicles. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has CarPlay, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has Android Auto. These systems support native, voice-controlled access to Apple Music and Google's various streaming music services.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- like Spotify -- relies on smartphones running software from Apple or Google to allow users to play its Prime Music or Amazon Music Unlimited in the car. To reduce that dependence somewhat (the smartphone is still needed but Alexa is front and center) Amazon announced the Echo Auto in 2018.

The Verge reported technical details on the new SPOT hardware. It is clearly designed to become the focus for a driver who wants to listen to music (or podcasts) while driving. The Spotify Car Thing plugs into a vehicle's 12v outlet for power, then connects to both the car stereo and the user's smartphone via Bluetooth. From there, drivers can control music playback via voice by saying &quot;Hey Spotify.&quot; The hardware includes a small display that shows details on what is bing played, and preset buttons for user playlists. SPOT Says Streaming Audio Remains the FocusCompetitors like Apple make the majority of their revenue through selling hardware. However, SPOT is insistent it doesn't have similar ambitions. The company was quite clear that music -- and podcasts -- will remain its priority.&quot;While we know there has been some speculation about our future plans, Car Thing was developed to help us learn more about how people listen to music and podcasts. Our focus remains on becoming the world's number one audio platform -- not on creating hardware.&quot; When Will the Spotify Car Thing be Available?Consumers may be waiting quite some time to get their hands on a Spotify Car Thing, and they may never get a crack at it. According to Spotify, testing starts shortly but only in the U.S. and only for a &quot;small group of invited Spotify Premium users.&quot;The company also says specifically that it has no current plans to make the Car Thing available to buy. So What's the Point?In the intro, I mentioned the Spotify Car Thing has one purpose. And yes, from a consumer's point of view being able to listen to Spotify Music and control it via voice would be the sole purpose of having a Car Thing. But what's Spotify's angle? Especially if the company isn't aiming for hardware revenue for diversification or to help reduce Spotify stock's reliance on subscriber growth?First, it would be a good idea to take the claims of not being interested in hardware with a grain of salt. If SPOT sold the Car Thing for $50 -- what Amazon is charging for the Echo Auto -- and you multiply that by even a fraction of the 100 million paid subscribers, there is real revenue potential there.The company also teased in its announcement that other hardware like a &quot;Home Thing&quot; could make a future appearance, so SPOT could be finally making a play for a share of a smart speaker market projected to be worth over $23 billion by 2025. Clearly revenue from hardware sales does have significant potential upside for Spotify stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential Spotify itself spikes out a key reason for the Car Thing. Americans are spending 70 billion hours a year driving, and the company wants to learn more about how those drivers listen to music and podcasts. By getting involved at the hardware level, SPOT can capture more granular data. And that information could prove critical for the company as it fine-tunes its streaming services to remain number one amid fierce competition.  As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.79%.In the options pits, call and put activity ended the day on equal footing, while overall volume fell to average levels. Specifically, about 16.2 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe relative calm made an impact at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to 0.65 -- a three-week low. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average inched higher to 0.72.Options activity was hot in the following three stocks: Sprint (NYSE:S), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's take a closer look: Sprint (S)Traders swarmed telecom stocks after the Federal Communications Chairman, Ajit Pai, said he's in favor of the $26.5 billion merger between Sprint and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) that was announced in 2018. After a volatile intraday ride, S stock ended the day up 18.8%. TMUS gained 3.87%. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) joined the rally, though their gains were pared significantly by the closing bell.  * 7 ETFs for Healthy Healthcare REITs With the surge, Sprint now sits at an eighteen month high. Before the pop, the stock was stuck in a sloppy range. Time will tell if a bona fide trend emerges. Until then, I suggest patience for Monday's gap to be digested and a better pattern to emerge.On the options trading front, puts surprisingly ruled the roost. Activity rocketed to 622% of the average daily volume, with 185,578 total contracts traded; 75% of the trading came from put options alone.With the resolution of the proposed merger now seemingly priced in, implied volatility dropped on the session to 93%. That places it at the 51st percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 43 cents or 6%. Alibaba (BABA)Trade war jitters already had Alibaba shares on the ropes, but a nasty earnings report from Chinese internet giant, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) delivered the knockout blow. The losses in BABA stock since peaking last month have now grown to 18%, placing the company's shares a stone's throw from bear market territory.Yesterday's 5.3% drubbing was enough to push the stock back below its 200-day moving average for the first time since February. With it now pushing into oversold territory, a rebound may be in the cards, but it has high odds of failing. If anything a pop back toward $170 or $175 should be eyed as a potential shorting opportunity.As far as options trading goes, calls won the day by a slim margin. Total activity grew to 191% of the average daily volume, with 383,956 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 54% of the tally.The increased demand drove implied volatility higher on the day to 35% placing it at the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.56 or 2.2%. Apple (AAPL)Apple is another victim of the latest round of tariff-induced trauma. In a client note, Credit Suisse highlighted the threat that further deterioration in the trade war poses to Apple earnings for 2019. With Greater China contributing 20% to the company's 2018 revenue and operating profit, the health of its economy is of utmost importance to Apple earnings.The recent drop in AAPL stock has it trading below all major moving averages. Watch for a break back above $192.50 resistance to signal that the short-term downtrend is reversing and bears have officially been evicted from the premises.On the options trading front, traders favored puts over calls. Activity held steady at 100% of the average daily volume, with 582,288 total contracts traded. Puts claimed 51% of the day's take.Implied volatility lifted to 33% or the 51st percentile of its one-year range. The expected daily move now stands at $3.76 or 2.1%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Yes, it seems like old times! It's as if the prior issues and controversies such as with privacy and security breaches have simply just gone away. The bottom line: For the year so far, the Facebook stock price has clocked a gain of 42%. To put this into perspective, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is up 12%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gained 22% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has returned 32%.Source: Shutterstock OK then, what can investors now expect with Facebook stock? Has the move been overdone? Or is there still an opportunity here?Well, we may not see the same kind of gains. After all, the markets are looking kind of dicey right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut then again, I still think FB stock will still do relatively well. If anything, it may be a source of stability in a volatile environment.So let's take a look at three key factors for the bull case on Facebook stock: FB Stock - Barriers To EntryWhen Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) evaluates a stock, it looks for a moat. This is a strong barrier to entry against competitors.Facebook actually has multiple moats. They include the main Facebook platform, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. In all, these properties have a staggering 2.38 billion users and 2.1 billion use them on a daily basis.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) The recent privacy issues have shown just how resilient these apps are. For the most part, users have not really cared much. They generally see that the value of Facebook's apps as standout. Keep in mind that in the latest quarter the annual growth rate of the user base was 8%.This is certainly impressive given the scale. What's more, as seen with other social media operators like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), it's no easy feat to grow a user base.So Facebook's moats position the company to keep getting an out-sized portion of the global ad opportunity. FB Stock - GrowthGrowth continues to be robust. In the latest quarter, FB reported that revenues jumped by 26% to $15.1 billion. There was also $6.4 billion in operating earnings (this excludes the $3 billion reserved for a potential payout for a fine to the Federal Trade Commission). And yes, a key driver has been Instagram. According to Kenshoo, the app saw 44% growth in spending in Q1.But there is also a secular trend towards digital advertising. IDC forecasts that the market will go from $229 billion in 2017 to $360 billion by 2021, which is a compound annual growth rate of nearly 11%.To keep up the growth rate, FB has several important levers. These include WhatsApp and Messenger, which are in the early stages of monetization. Facebook also is exploring entering new categories, such as payments (with a focus on a cryptocurrency) and ecommerce, such as with Instagram Checkout and Marketplace.True, these are tough markets to crack. But the company has the big-time advantage of a massive user base and a treasure trove of data. FB Stock - ValuationEven with the run-up in FB, the valuation remains at a reasonable level. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 20X, which represents a discount to the company's growth ramp.Wall Street is also getting more bullish. For example, the average price target is $221.50, which assumes about 18% upside from current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

Netflix will soon lose Disney's (NYSE:DIS) content. Moreover, it faces more companies adding a streaming service. Amid these threats, Netflix stock continues its long-term uptrend.Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified)So far, Netflix has maintained this lead with new content and market expansion. However, keeping this current pace could hurt holders of Netflix directly. With a heavy debt load, the company may have little choice but to issue more shares, directly undermining the value of NFLX stock.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks)  Transformation and Netflix stockNetflix has become arguably the most transformative company of the last decade. Looking back, some might find it hard to believe that the Justice Department once fretted over the attempt by Blockbuster Video to take over its then-largest competitor, Hollywood Video. Netflix made this irrelevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the last few years, we have also seen consumers increasingly drop pay-TV services in favor of streaming video. The once-loved programming of the major networks only gains scant attention today. Again, we have Netflix to thank.Consequently, valuations in Netflix stock have remained high for several years. Admittedly, I have predicted Netflix's relative decline for a long time, and the market has responded with a higher price for Netflix. For now, content and aggressive international expansion have kept Netflix ahead of its competition. Netflix Stock Isn't ProfitableHowever, I think our own James Brumley points to the real problem that true profitability remains elusive. As he points out, Netflix will reportedly spend $15 billion on content in 2019, up from the $12 billion in outlays for 2018.Interestingly, the company balance sheet states that &quot;cost of revenue&quot; came in at only $9.97 billion for 2018. Content seems like a cost of revenue to me. Regardless, these numbers indicate that if Netflix considered its homegrown material a true cost of revenue, it does not earn a profit.So far, Wall Street has not punished Netflix stock. Moreover, even though I disagree with my colleague Will Ashworth on NFLX, I think he correctly predicts that Disney+ will not lead to widespread cancellations of Netflix service. But the worries extend beyond Disney+. They extend to Disney's Hulu, Prime Video from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which can afford to outspend Netflix on content, and numerous others. Stockholders Will PayNetflix has now resorted to junk bonds to fund its expansion. As a result, it currently holds about $10.3 billion in long-term debt. This has become a heavy burden on a firm with only $5.7 billion in stockholders' equity. When the junk bond market ceases to remain an option, the company will have little choice but to cut content spending or resort to issuing more stock.As it is, NFLX stock trades at about 127 trailing earnings. The equity supports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just over 60. Admittedly, many traders will pay that multiple if the predicted earnings increases of 27.6% this year and 71.3% in 2020 come to pass. However, if the supply of shares proliferates, investor sentiment could cool off.Looking at the charts, one might wonder if it has already cooled off. Since February, Netflix has traded in a narrow range. Time will tell whether this period is a pause before moving higher or an indication of increasing doubts about NFLX.For this reason, I do not recommend a short position. However, with a steadily worsening balance sheet and negative cash flows, I would not own this name at current levels. Final Thoughts on Netflix StockNetflix may soon have to fund its content budget with aggressive share issuance, thereby undermining the stock's value. For most of its history, Netflix has built itself on market disruption.Now, with numerous companies copying its model, it has had to move into new markets and spend heavily on content to stay ahead.However, the cost of this expansion has forced NFLX to issue increasing amounts of junk bonds. With more debt becoming less of an option, Netflix will have to become just another streaming company or dilute its stock. Both options bode poorly for holders of Netflix stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

While the new affordable Pixel 3a smartphones got much of the spotlight, the company also announced big changes with Nest, which is now called Google Nest and becoming the umbrella brand for all of Google smart home products. As part of that move and a new focus on privacy, the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program will be axed by the end of August, replaced by Google Assistant. And that leaves a big opening for Google's smart home competitors.Source: Google Here's why. &quot;Works With Nest&quot; Will No Longer Work With Nest One of the themes at Google I/O 2019 was a commitment to privacy. Owners of Nest smart home products -- now known as Google Nest smart home products -- soon discovered that means big changes for their devices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGoogle announced that at the end of August, it is ending the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program. That means other smart home devices that integrated with Nest products will lose their access. The company is hoping product developers will release updates to make the devices compatible with its &quot;Works With Google Assistant&quot; program, but that requires investment on the part of the device makers. And it also means that most of these devices won't have access to anywhere near the same data they currently get from Nest. An Opening for CompetitorsThe smart home market is a big one, and it is seeing rapid growth. According to the latest numbers from IDC, shipment of smart home devices is expected to increase 26.9% year-over-year for 2019, hitting 832.7 million units. The market leaders are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung both beginning to make an impact. Growth has largely been driven by smart speakers to this point, but for 2019, that segment is projected to slow significantly. Instead, the big gains are expected to be in categories like smart lighting and home monitoring.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills According to IDC's analysts:&quot;2019 will be more about tying the various devices together to form a more cohesive experience and more importantly, layering in additional services.&quot;And that's where Google's move to axe the &quot;Works with Nest&quot; program is going to hurt, at least in the short term. Third-party companies have already begun to notify customers that their smart home products will cease to integrate with Nest devices, &quot;breaking&quot; smart home systems that may have been working for years. The Verge notes that this extends to some pretty big partnerships. For example, Amazon's Alexa will no longer be able to adjust temperatures on a Nest thermostat and users will no longer be able to ask Alexa to display video feeds from a Nest Cam. In addition, the loss of IFTTT support cuts Nest devices out of many other smart home setups.Speaking from personal experience, I have a Nest thermostat that is integrated with both an air quality sensor (which kicks on the furnace fan to increase air circulation when elevated CO2 levels are detected), and my home security system (which uses the Nest to automatically adjust temperatures based on security status). Neither of these systems works with Google Assistant, so they are likely to cease functioning later this summer. Based on the data they require, neither is likely to work the same way, even if they are eventually transitioned to the Works With Google Assistant program.    * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade In other words, Google's move runs contrary to the driving trend IDC and others see in the smart home market. The timing opens the doors to competitors to move in and gain ground on Nest in the smart home. Amazon will undoubtedly be pushing hard, and smaller competitors see an opening they are preparing to capitalize on. Ecobee, for example, is rumored to not only have a new smart thermostat in the works, but also an expansion into smart home security with a camera and sensors.  Move Is Unlikely to Help GOOGL Stock â¦ For NowWhen Google bought Nest Labs in 2014 for $3.2 billion, it acquired the leader in smart thermostats and smoke detectors, and one of the biggest names in smart home integration. With the growth of the smart home, this had significant upside for GOOGL stock. However, for the first few years, Nest floundered under Google ownership and at one point, it seemed on the verge of imploding. The brand has stabilized recently and expanded into video doorbells, outdoor cameras and other smart home security components.Long term, Google's newfound dedication to privacy is likely to pay off. But in the short term, at least, there is going to be some pain as Works with Nest is shut down and many smart home adopters see their integrated systems suddenly become a lot &quot;dumber as a result. That's going to make Nest products a tougher sell, cause resentment and open the doors for competitors to move in.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since a massive upward spike following the settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it continued a move upward before finding a new trading range. The recently released earnings report became a mild drag on Qualcomm stock. Now, with the battle with Apple over, another obstacle has arisen that could create another buying opportunity in QCOM stock.Source: Karlis Dambrans via FlickrBack in December, I predicted that 5G would end the winter of discontent for QCOM stock. The first sign of that came when Qualcomm settled with Apple and the shares spiked more than 37% higher in 24 hours as the companies announced the agreement. The iPhone maker likely concluded that QCOM could serve its needs better than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in this regard and cut a deal. QCOM Stock's Found a New Trading RangeSince that spike, QCOM stock has leveled off over the last couple of weeks. It also fell slightly after earnings and the company's guide lower. Admittedly, the present financials appear uninspiring. Analysts expect only 6.8% earnings growth this fiscal year. The current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio stands at 44.6.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Nonetheless, investors should not assume that they have missed out on QCOM stock. Thanks to 5G, the picture improves dramatically in the next fiscal year. As recently as a month ago, analysts predicted $4.35 per share in earnings for fiscal 2020. Reaction to the Apple settlement added a buck to that and the projection now stands at $5.38 per share. China's the Next HeadwindThat settled, another political battle has now emerged. Unlike the dispute with Apple, this fight appears in the geopolitical realm, largely outside of the company's control.The majority of the company's revenue comes from China. This places possible near-term pressure on the QCOM as the trade dispute between the U.S. and the People's Republic continues to simmer and flare.On the flip side, China may find it needs to follow Apple's lead. The need for 5G may force them to come to an agreement similar to the one Apple made with Qualcomm. I would not expect another 37% one-day spike in such an instance. Still, such a settlement would easily break QCOM stock out of the range where it has traded in recent weeks. Low PE, High Payout Adds to QCOM Stock AppealTo be sure, even if such a deal takes some time, other factors make QCOM stock worth the wait. Despite the much-higher earnings projection for fiscal 2020, the forward PE comes in at just 15.7x. That multiple will bring an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.5% that year. Going further out, Wall Street projects average annual profit increases of 27.05% per year over the next five years.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes Furthermore, Qualcomm will make it worth it for investors to wait for the 5G revolution. Qualcomm's current dividend stands at $2.48 a share, which takes the yield to just over 2.9%. While that pales in comparison to the 4.3% yield before the price spike, it still comes in well above S&P 500 index averages. QCOM has also increased this payout every year for the last eight years. If these payout hikes remained safe during the recent years of struggle for QCOM stock, they should continue once consumers begin buying 5G-compatible devices. Final Thoughts on QCOM StockFollowing its settlement with Apple, QCOM stock again trades in a range as the company faces its next battle. The magnitude of QCOM's post-settlement move, coupled with a mixed earnings report, may weigh on the equity for now. Moreover, the company relies on China for the majority of its revenue. Such concerns could bring the same stagnation to Qualcomm stock that the shares faced during the Apple dispute.However, much like Apple, China may also have to agree to a trade settlement to move forward in 5G. Once the China situation becomes more settled and manufacturers begin to sell 5G-compatible phones in earnest, QCOM stock will have nowhere to go but up.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The tariff rate will increase from 10% to 25%. Additionally, Trump announced they are starting the process of slapping another 25% tariff on the remaining $320 billion of Chinese imports thus far not affected by the trade standoff.China, for its part, has vowed to take retaliatory measures.This is pretty much the worst-case scenario, coming after months of hinting and teasing in the press that a deal was forthcoming. Tech stocks in particular are looking vulnerable here, as they are highly sensitive to global supply chain linkages. Higher tariffs will directly eat into profitability margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days As a result, the group is slumping. Here are five tech stocks to sell now: Apple (AAPL)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which loves to tout that its products are &quot;Designed in California,&quot; has thus far avoided being impacted by the Chinese import tariffs Trump has enacted, as the product codes for its iPhone and Airpods and other devices have been left out of the regulatory changes. But with Trump threatening to tariff all products, the company will soon no longer be able to skirt higher customs costs.Investors are dumping shares in response, and AAPL stock is threatening to fall below its 50-day moving average for the first time since October. Watch for a possible decline down to the February-March lows, which would be a worth a decline of roughly 13% from here. The company will likely next report results on July 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.11 per share on revenues of $53.5 billion. Alphabet (GOOG)Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have pulled back violently from a recent push to record highs, collapsing below their 50-day moving average and closing in on the 200-day average. This after the tech stock reported a surprise revenue miss late last month, posting the slowest growth in four years as ad pricing came under pressure.  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From This is a bigger deal than it seems at first, since so much of the technology ecosystem depends on display and text ad pricing. Prior to this, the company last reported on Feb. 4, with earnings of $10.95 beating estimates by four cents on a 16.7% rise in revenues. Micron Technology (MU)Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares are falling below both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, threatening to break the March-low support and return to the lows not seen since December. Such a move would be worth a loss of more than 25% from here. The tech stock's China segment revenue is at risk from deepening trade tensions and a possible nationalist blowback against Apple products in China, which Micron supplies components for.The company is scheduled to next report results on June 19 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 85 cents per share on revenues of $4.8 billion. When the company last reported on March 20, earnings of $1.71 beat estimates by five cents on a 20.6% decline in revenues. Snap (SNAP)While Uber (NYSE:UBER) is getting all the IPO attention these days, 2017 IPO Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is coming under pressure as the social media darling continues to struggle after an ill-reviewed Snapchat redesign and an odd move to relabel itself a &quot;camera company&quot; with its Spectacles wearable device (which are horribly ugly, by the way).Shares have dropped back below their 50-day moving average and are exiting a three-month consolidation range. Watch for a drop back to the 200-day moving average, which would be worth a loss of more than 14% from here.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips The company will next report results on Aug. 6 after the close. Analysts are looking for a loss of 10 cents per share on revenues of $356.5 million. When the company last reported on April 23, a loss of 10 cents per share beat estimates by two cents on a 38.9% rise in revenues. Alibaba (BABA)Speaking of Uber, it is the largest IPO by market cap after eclipsing Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Shares are drifting lower on worries about the domestic Chinese economy in the wake of higher U.S. tariffs. Shares are threatening to fall out of a four-month consolidation range, setting up a retest of the October-December lows. Not exactly what KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts expected when they raised their price target to $240 back on May 7.The company will next report results on May 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 98 cents per share on revenues of $13.4 billion.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any fo the aforementioned securities.

And in this case, it's a huge swath of American women, who have built the new althleisure movement.Source: Shutterstock Traditionally, most athletic wear was usually built for function more than form. But that started to change in the 1980s. Whether it was hip-hop stars, Russian mobsters or stay at home moms, it seemed everyone was adopting warm-up suits as a form of leisurewear.LULU took it to the next level. As the Gen Xers started to get older, their idea of an active lifestyle left the tennis court or aerobics class and was branching out into spinning and yoga. And these new activities called for a rethinking of athletic wear, something that you would be supportive in the gym but also attractive and comfortable outside it. And new fabric technology changed the baggy tracksuit into a form-fitting sheath.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLULU also began to make this new &quot;athleisure&quot; wear more feminine as well. And this was what really started to separate it from the mass market products around.  * 10 Stocks That Could Squeeze Short Sellers, Including CGC And that niche has belonged to LULU ever since. What's more, because it was less available and higher quality, there was an inherent mystique about it that continues to this day. It's like the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of athleisure.Nowhere is that more obvious than LULU stock. Its July 2007 debut had the stock in the low teens. It doubled by late 2010. Now the stock is trading around $174. In the past 12 months, LULU stock is up 77% and my Portfolio Grader still rates it an A -- a strong buy.What's more, even with that kind of outsized growth, Lululemon stock is still trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 48. That's pretty impressive. Usually a company with this kind of growth, market dominance and name recognition would be at a P/E far above its growth rate. The Truth Behind LULU Stock's GrowthOne thing that has kept LULU stock and company on this growth trajectory is the fact that it only sells direct to consumer, either online or in its stores. This gives it generous margins, allows it to sell higher quality products and keeps its pricing where it needs to be to keep those margins strong.Recently LULU has announced that it's introducing an annual membership model, launching a line for men and children, and most recently announced that it's going to start making its own shoes.Select stores sold a line of APL shoes since 2017, but now it seems that LULU is serious about selling its own branded shoes. It also expects to double revenue from its men's line as well as boost its ecommerce sales, sooner rather than later.As long as the economy continues to expand, LULU is in a great place. Many younger men and women are more interested in quality over quantity, so a couple of pairs of Lululemon products are preferable to a closet or drawer full of lower priced, lesser quality products.And given its high-end branding, LULU is going to give the bigger players like Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour (NYSE:UAA, NYSE:UA) a run for their money.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

While there was plenty to talk about, including a newfound dedication to privacy, Android Q, a &quot;next generation&quot; Android Assistant and big moves on the Google Nest front, what's making headlines this morning is the new Google Pixel 3a smartphone. If you're a consumer, there's a lot to like about Google's affordable new phone.Source: Google But is the Pixel 3a the right move for Google and GOOGL stock? Will it do what three generations of flagship Pixel phones have failed to do and jumpstart sales? Google Announces the Affordable Pixel 3aAt its Google I/O 2019 keynote event, Google announced a new, affordable smartphone: the Pixel 3a (and Pixel 3a XL).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhere the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL start at $799 and $899, respectively, the Pixel 3a is $399, while the 3a XL starts at $479.The big news is that the new affordable Pixel smartphones include the same camera that Google has been winning accolades for. The processor may be a bit slower (a Snapdragon 670 instead of a Snapdragon 845), but it's still a solid performer, and the display is an OLED panel. Other then the CPU, the primary cost-cutting measures on Google's part have been to use polycarbonate instead of glass for the back panel and to leave out water resistance and wireless charging. There's also no second front camera for wide angle selfies.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Those who aren't big on current design trends may even prefer the Pixel 3a, which lacks a screen notch and brings back the headphone jack.Why go affordable? Despite having what has been arguably the best camera in the business (Huawei's latest can top it but it is not available in the U.S.), after three generations, the Google Pixel smartphone has failed to win a meaningful marketshare. In 2017, the company reportedly sold 3.9 million units -- less than the number of iPhones rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was moving in a single week. And while Pixel sales had been showing signs of improvement -- at least in the U.S. market -- that has not been the case in 2019. During Alphabet's earnings call, declining Pixel sales were addressed directly by the company's CFO:&quot;Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industrywide, given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market.&quot;Going lower priced has worked for Apple. Its iPhone XR has reportedly been outselling both the iPhone Xs and iPhone XS Max combined. Even More Affordable (For a Limited Time)At $399, the Pixel 3a is a deal, but Google is sweetening the pot even further for a limited time. The company is offering 24 months of zero interest financing, that means consumers can pick up the new smartphone for under $17 monthly. It's also throwing in three free months of YouTube Music Premium. Trade in an old iPhone and Google knocks the price down to as low as $149.And until May 18, the company is offering a $100 credit with purchase to spend at the Google Store. The Risk(s) of CannibalizationSmartphone makers have always worried about cannibalizing their own sales if they release cheaper alternatives to their flagships. Google is unique in that the Pixel 3a could actually do this in several ways.First, the obvious. By equipping the Pixel 3a with the stellar camera of the Pixel 3, then charging half the price, Google is risking cutting into sales of its flagship smartphones. Many consumers buy a smartphone for its camera, and now those who were circling a Pixel 3 have the option of saving themselves $400. But the Pixel phones, in general, were also meant to be Android showcases, smartphones that would tempt users away from Apple's iPhone. However, in reality, research has shown that most Pixel buyers who are converting from another brand are former Samsung owners. There's a risk the $399 Pixel 3a may only accelerate that trend of winning sales form existing Android manufacturers.  * 7 Tips for Financial Planners to Gain a Competitive Edge The upside for GOOGL stock is the likelihood for increased hardware unit sales. The potential downsides are a lower ASP and the possibility of less revenue even if overall smartphone unit sales are up -- plus the risk of little net change in Android adoption marketshare. Throwing Down the Gauntlet to AppleWith its latest smartphone, Google has signaled that it is serious about winning market share. The Pixel 3 hasn't been able to do that, despite an award-winning camera. But the Pixel 3a's affordable starting price sends a clear message, especially to Apple, whose &quot;affordable&quot; model iPhone XR is priced $350 higher. Google is ready to play hardball.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2141,4313,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-announcements-google-o-143223494.html?.tsrc=rss,5 Big Announcements From Google I/O 2019,2019-05-08,"Yesterday was one of the biggest in the calendar of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division. Google I/O 2019 -- the company's annual developer conference -- kicked off with today's keynote.It's a big deal for consumers, industry watchers and investors. Some 85% of the company's revenue comes through advertising, so all the latest software developments designed to keep consumers hooked on Android are important. And the company also announced new hardware, as it continues to work toward diversifying revenue and reducing the dependence of GOOGL stock on advertising.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips There was a lot on tap during the duration of the event, but here are five of the big announcements from today's Google I/O 2019 keynote.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips &quot;Next Generation&quot; Google AssistantSource: Google Thanks to machine learning, Google Assistant is now up to 10 times faster. Google is referring to the technology as &quot;next generation&quot; and in addition to being faster, it's getting much better at context and gains a driving mode (coming as a free update this summer).Also seeing big leaps in capability are other AI-powered Google services including Google Lens, Duplex and Live Transcribe. Pixel 3a SmartphonesSource: Google Google's Pixel smartphones have impressed, especially with their camera capabilities. But they've failed to build a significant market share.To help boost sales, Google is introducing a new pair of mid-range smartphones called the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. Starting at $399 ($479 for the 3a XL), these new smartphones are half the price of most flagship devices. They offer a camera experience on par with the Pixel 3, including Night Sight, Portrait Mode and Super Res Zoom and feature OLED displays (and a headphone jack). Google cut costs by using a Snapdragon 670 processor instead of the more expensive Snapdragon 845 in the Pixel 3, using cheaper plastic instead of a glass for the back panel, forgoing wireless charging and skipping water resistance.  * 6 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The Pixel3a and 3a XL are available starting today. NestSource: Google Google accidentally leaked the Nest Hub Max prior to today's event, so it seemed likely that new Nest gear was on tap. And yes, the company did announce the Nest Hub Max, a smart speaker with a camera and big 10-inch display.But the company had a surprise up its sleeve: all Google Home products will be coming under the Nest brand umbrella. Coming late this summer, the Nest Hub Max will be priced at $229, while the original Google Hub (now the Nest Hub) gets a price cut to $129. Android QSource: Google Android is the operating system that powers the vast majority of smartphones, and keeping that dominance -- which helps to keep that ad revenue flowing through native Google services -- is critical to the bottom line, and to the continued growth of Google stock. Today the company showed off features of Android Q (alternately known as Android 10), including support for folding smartphones (like Samsung's Galaxy Fold), a new dark mode and new navigation gestures.  * 3 Oil Stocks to Buy in a Recovering Refining Market Also coming to Google users both mobile and PC-based, is a new emphasis on privacy and security, with the option to automatically delete your history in services including Search, Maps and Google Assistant. In addition, Search and Maps will get an incognito mode for private use. Google I/O 2019: Android AutoSource: Google While it was announced shortly before the keynote itself, the update to Android Auto is an important one.Google has revamped the user interface, with the new version of the software coming this summer. Android Auto's UI is now adaptable to different screen sizes, which is needed with more auto makers now offering the system in their vehicles. Navigation between apps is improved and Google says more info is now available to drivers at a glance.That's it for big news out of Google I/O 2019 today. But there's another huge tech developer conference less than a month away. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) WWDC 2019 is coming up in less than a month.

2148,4320,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-buy-nike-stock-135425969.html?.tsrc=rss,5 Reasons to Buy Nike Stock on Weakness,2019-05-08,"Shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) have been red hot for the past year and a half, rallying roughly 80% from their $50 lows in late 2017, to fresh  all-time highs around $90 just a few weeks ago. But Nike stock is pulling back in early May, amid a stock-market selloff sparked by renewed trade war threats.Source: Shutterstock As of this writing, Nike stock is 7% off its recent highs, marking the biggest drop in NKE stock in 2019.  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips Investors should perceive the recent weakness of Nike stock as a buying opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn general, Nike is firing on all cylinders and extending its leadership position in an athletic-apparel market that has been, still is, and will remain on fire. This favorable positioning sets NKE up to report healthy, robust revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future. As a result,  Nike stock will stay on a healthy medium to long-term uptrend.Further, with respect to the near-term, NKE has a few major fundamental catalysts on the horizon which should get many investors to buy Nike stock soon.All in all, it won't be long before Nike stock is making new all time highs. Consequently, NKE stock should be bought on its recent weakness. The Athletic Apparel Space Remains Red HotThere are five reasons to buy the dip of Nike stock in May. The first of those five reasons is that athletic apparel remains as hot and in-demand as ever.Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) just reported another stellar quarter which dazzled investors and sent that stock up to all-time highs.  Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) has been on fire for a long time and has only improved in recent quarters. Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) just reported its best numbers in recent memory, including a 25% sales jump in the Asia-Pacific region.Everywhere you look, athletic apparel is still on fire. Nike is the unchallenged king of this space. As a result, as long as the athletic-apparel industry remains red hot, so will Nike. NKE Hasn't Experienced Any Trouble in ChinaThe second big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that the company has proven largely resilient to trade-war noise.Specifically, in late 2018, many U.S. companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), reported that their China businesses had weakened thanks to slowing economic conditions  sparked by the trade conflict. Nike was not one of those companies. Instead, Nike's China business remained healthy and vigorous. Throughout all of fiscal 2018, NKE's China sales rose 18%. Its China sales rose 20% in the first quarter of 2019, 31% in Q2, and 24% in Q3.In other words, Nike's China business has yet to be negatively impacted by trade-war issues or the slowing Chinese economy. Consequently, the current  weakness of Nike stock seems overstated. Tiger Woods Is BackThe third big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that the company's golf business will get a nice bump this quarter and perhaps for the foreseeable future.That's because Nike golf star Tiger Woods is back. In mid-April, Tiger Woods won the 2019 Masters golf tournament for the first time in 14 years, completing what many are calling one of the greatest comeback stories in sports history. That comeback story caused certain Nike golf apparel to sell  out on Nike's website in the 24 hours after Woods' victory.Nike's quarterly results should reflect the rebound of its golf business sparked by Woods' victory. As long as Woods remains relevant, this lift should persist. The Freak Shoe Launches SoonThe fourth (and arguably the biggest) reason to buy Nike stock in May is that this company is heading into what looks  to be a massive signature basketball shoe launch, and prior successful signature basketball shoe launches have sparked huge rallies by NKE stock.Specifically, Nike is set to release a signature basketball shoe for NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo within the next few weeks. The shoe, dubbed The Freak 1, will likely debut to enormous demand, considering Giannis is widely loved by fans, is one of the best players in the NBA, and has a unique underdog story which consumers will strongly relate to. Furthermore, prior signature basketball shoe launches by NBA stars Kyrie Irving and Paul George sparked big multi-quarter rallies of Nike stock.The same thing should happen this time around. The Freak 1 will launch in May. Demand will be robust. NKE will sell a ton of basketball shoes. The numbers will improve, causing NKE stock to head higher. Women's Pivot Unlocks Enormous Long-Term PotentialThe last big reason to buy Nike stock on weakness is that this company is only scratching the surface of its long-term potential in the women's athletic-apparel business.At the current moment, Nike's revenues are dominated by the men's segment. The women's business accounts for less than a quarter of its total revenues. But the global women's athletic apparel and footwear market is 50% larger than the men's athletic apparel and footwear market. Nike knows that, understands the huge potential  of its women's business, and is doing everything possible to grow its women's business, with management calling it a &quot;huge priority&quot; on the company's last earnings call.I think the revenue of Nike's women's business can reach $20 billion-plus over the next several years, and that's enough to enable Nike stock to march towards $100 this year. The Bottom Line on NKE StockNike stock is tumbling against the backdrop of the stock market selloff. But the recent weakness of Nike stock is nothing more than a buying opportunity. Over the long-term, NKE has all the pieces it needs to generate healthy revenue and profit growth. In the near-term, NKE has some major catalysts on the horizon which could turn this selloff into a rally rather quickly.It won't be long before Nike stock is printing fresh, all-time highs again.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NKE, LULU, and AAPL.

Most major consumer-tech firms, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), performed strongly out of the gate in 2019. Sony stock? It spent the first three months of this year testing investors' patience.Source: Game GavelHowever, those troubles and miscues seem to have resolved themselves. On April 1, SNE stock was staring at near-double digit losses. But since that day, shares have absolutely soared, gaining almost 22%. Even after the overall market's stumble this week, SNE stock is still in the black for the year to the tune of about 2%.Of course, this is nothing compared to its top-dog rivals. Apple has gained 30% year-to-date. Microsoft is no slouch either, up 25%. But Sony stock levers something these other two companies don't: the almighty PlayStation video-game console.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLate last week, the on-again, off-again tech firm released the first details about its next-generation console. If management keeps to its naming convention, it will be called the PlayStation 5, or PS5. However, SNE has done some strange things in the past, so the name is no guarantee.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May But what is almost guaranteed is that the PS5 will be a game-changer for Sony stock. Over the years, management has made significant investments into their entertainment umbrella. The PS5 represents the culmination of these (expensive) efforts.Specifically, here are three reasons why you can bank on SNE stock and the upcoming PS5, or whatever it will be called: Sony's New Gaming System Is Loaded with TechEvery PlayStation console represented a leap forward in gaming visuals. Back when the PS3 came out, people marveled at the life-like graphics. When Sony launched the successor PS4, the line between virtual reality and actual reality became all the more blurred.Sometimes, when I quickly glance at a PS4 screenshot, I can't tell whether I'm looking at a video game or a real-life broadcast. The PS5 promises to push the bar even higher. SNE confirmed that this latest gaming hardware will utilize chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Specifically, we're talking about a CPU based on third-gen Ryzen, and eight cores of the Zen 2 seven-nanometer microchip.Given the massive sales success of the PS4, I think we'll see dramatic metrics for the successor. Therefore, don't be surprised to see Sony stock jump around the release date.Furthermore, one of the biggest differences for the next-gen PlayStation is that it will incorporate a solid-state drive. Currently, Sony's consoles integrate traditional hard drives, which have improved dramatically over the years. However, they're incredibly slow in this age of ultra-fast response rates.Although I love my PS4, I don't care for the several seconds I must wait for my game to transition from one major section to another. A solid-state drive, which features no moving parts, gets to the data much quicker than a regular hard drive.Of course, a solid-state drive costs significantly more than its counterpart. Management wants to keep the PS5 reasonably priced, so we'll see how that goes. However, I don't think consumers will mind paying more for a quicker platform. Content Umbrella Favors Sony StockYou don't have to be an entertainment-media expert to recognize the growing trend in consolidation. Earlier, market pundits debated the wisdom of AT&T (NYSE:T) expensively acquiring Time Warner. Next, analysts shined the spotlight on Disney (NYSE:DIS) and its bid for Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) entertainment assets.Conservative investors didn't like that these big but vulnerable corporations were buying out others like them. Instead, they should have focused on shoring up their financials and building steady value for their shareholders.I appreciate this perspective. That said, I also appreciate that the nature of entertainment has changed, particularly with streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Today, it's more important than ever to deliver content that attracts both eyeballs and revenue-conversion opportunities. If you have good content, you can win despite the platform.Sony understands this entertainment trend better than most, which is why I trust SNE stock. They invested heavily into their own exclusive content umbrella. Observing these expenditures from the outside may lead you to believe that SNE is wasting money. Instead, what they're really doing is securing viable, lucrative synergies.One of the best ways they can leverage their entertainment portfolio is through PlayStation-exclusive titles. Here's the thing: other rivals also have exclusives. What makes Sony, and by logical deduction SNE stock distinct, though, is demand: people actually want to play Sony-only games. They're more than willing to fork over money for a new console to do so.Just look at the roaring success for Marvel's Spider-Man. Such massive inflows are only possible through leveraging popular branded content. While the initial investments were expensive, the potential for the PS5 to bring it all together is truly colossal.In other words, keep a very close eye on Sony stock. No Comparable Competition for SNE StockI'm a PlayStation guy for life. I don't think I can ever get used to the Xbox's strangely-shaped controls. They look like PS controls that were left in the microwave for some unknown reason.Of course, I'm incredibly biased as well. InvestorPlace readers may know me as that guy who worked for Sony. Naturally, I own Sony stock, so I have a vested interest in their continued upward trajectory.But even acknowledging that I'm not 100% objective, I don't think the company has comparable rivals in the gaming sector. I may tick off the Xbox folks, but the data confirms it. The PS4 is approaching the 100 million units sold mark. Although Microsoft doesn't break down Xbox figures, they're more or less approaching the 50 million threshold.But what about video-game streaming? Although streaming certainly has an impact on the broader gaming industry, I think this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. At least, that's the view when discussing SNE stock and the next-gen PlayStation.Streaming is designed to capture the very casual gamer. But for those that want the absolute best in visuals and experience, no substitute for a dedicated console exists. Briefly, we went over the tech that SNE will integrate into the PS5. To stream all that data would be a gargantuan undertaking.Plus, game-streaming competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) don't have content credibility. They're new to the game, and they can't whip out highly-desirable exclusives. Until they can climb these sharply vertical obstacles, your best bet in gaming is Sony stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE stock and T stock.

Although Spotify stock soared soon after its initial public offering, shares suffered from both fundamental questions and bad timing. In the aftermath of last October's broader market correction, SPOT eventually closed out 2018 down 14%.Source: Spotify This year, SPOT stock is enjoying much better fortune. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up around 21%. But on the fundamental end, questions are piling up. Spotify didn't endear themselves to Wall Street, badly missing its earnings target for the first quarter of 2019. Adding to the uncertainty, management recently announced they're bringing voice-controlled advertisements to the streaming platform for a limited user base.Although increased interaction with smart devices represent the future, the concept of voice-controlled ads bring up dystopian imagery for me. Apparently, I'm not the only one. Gizmodo contributor Catie Keck blasted the move as an &quot;engagement hellscape.&quot; That's hardly a ringing endorsement for the new marketing direction or indirectly for Spotify stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May But I certainly understand Keck's reservations. Here's how this next-generation ad works: Spotify will initially target some users who have their microphone enabled. The streaming app will then feature an ad that requests the listener to speak a keyword. If the listener utters the magic phrase, the ad will presumably provide a detailed sales pitch. If not, the ad just plays out, and the music returns.Now, that doesn't sound too terrible. Some folks might say that this is a convenience, and therefore, a net benefit to SPOT stock. However, Keck looks out to future: what if advertisers inundate streaming channels with annoying phrase-requested ads, pestering you until you give in?Ticking off the user base is a no-no for Spotify stock. Why Voice-Controlled Ads Could Lift Spotify StockI share Keck's reservations. At the same time, every story has two sides. Keck speaks from the (free) end-user's perspective, who come to the table with many demands. On the other end sits the business angle. Here, the line is, beggars can't be choosers.Let's get down to the numbers. Recently, SPOT hit a major milestone, garnering more than 100 million paid users. Most notably, the music-streaming firm beat out rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which only has 50 million paid users. This fact alone makes Spotify stock a compelling look.However, the flipside is that the company projects 107 million to 110 million paid users against a total listening base between 222 million to 228 million users. Thus, a little over half are using Spotify's free service, which isn't a bad conversion rate. Unfortunately, the company still sheds money.In order to convince prospective buyers to remain interested in SPOT stock, management must try new conversion tactics. If that involves annoying listeners until they open their wallet, so be it. When you look at the rising number of paying subs, it's obvious that the music-listening audience have few viable alternatives.Sure, the growth rate in paid users has consecutively declined since Q1 2017. Bulls will counter, though, that this is merely the law of large numbers shifting its weight. And when you look at the metric objectively, the growth rate is still robust. Since Q1 2018, paid-user growth on a year-over-year basis averages just under 39%. From Q1 2016, the rate is 54%.In other words, Spotify is expanding one of its most critical components even after the &quot;newness&quot; factor has faded. But since the company is still not generating a profit, it must take its ventures to the next level. Voice-controlled ads could do the trick for Spotify stock. SPOT Stock Is Merely Adapting to Tech TrendsNo one likes commercials, even if they fund our &quot;free&quot; entertainment. Logically, then, no one wants these necessary evils to become more intrusive.Keck is right in that advertisers will game the system to somehow force watchers and listeners to pay attention, and later, to pay up. However, complaining about the ad industry's brave new world is ultimately a waste of time.Everywhere you turn, the digitalization sector is telegraphing voice-controlled ads. We live in a world where devices from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) act as our personal assistants. We speak to them, giving them orders and asking for information. Although the tech is not yet perfect, it's getting there.Therefore, it's inevitable that content marketed to us will come in the form of requested vocal engagement. Many folks may find this development disturbing. But don't blame Spotify stock: the underlying company is merely a product of its time.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

For all that contrarian investors have tried to explain that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) valuation is stretched, that it's time is up, Netflix stock has continued higher.Source: Via NetflixAt the time of writing, valuations do look extreme at 135x earnings, but Netflix stock has run over those who have been caught short. Short-sellers may have very cogent theses and numerous reasons why Netflix stock is overvalued, but the price action over the past couple of years has put them in their place.The reality is that fighting the trend has been a losing proposition. YTD, Netflix stock performance has been stellar: up 42 percent, compared to the NASDAQ Composite's 26 percent.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes The FAANGs have stymied many value-oriented investors, and Netflix is no exception. Even now, its ascent skyward seems to show few signs of slowing. Netflix's Solid First QuarterSubscribers is the metric the market seems to care most about. Free cash flow, content spend, and even margins have taken a backseat to subscriber growth. On this front, Netflix is delivering. In the first quarter, average streaming paid memberships increased 26% year over year.  Excluding F/X, global streaming ARPU improved 3% year over year. This ultimately drove revenue growth of 22 percent.Paid net adds clocked in at 9.6 million. The US and international breakout is 1.74m and 7.86m, respectively. In aggregate, this 16 percent year-over-year increase set a quarterly record. For the first half of 2019, that gets Netflix to 14.6m paid net adds, up 7% year over year.The subscriber growth and price increase have been major factors in supporting the movement in Netflix stock and could continue in the second half of the year with new content being released. Netflix Takes on the WorldThe international business growth is worth paying close attention to. It's been the crux of many bear arguments. The idea is that the international market is fragmented due to different cultures with different tastes making it hard to compete with a small content library. There is a belief that regional competition will eat Netflix for lunch but that just hasn't happened.Netflix has gotten in early and continuously iterated their platform. They've learned about content that plays well and content that doesn't in local markets. The result is that, from a long-term standpoint, it's very likely that international business eclipses the U.S. business.With such a strong platform and compelling content, Netflix has been able to roll out price increases across the U.S., Brazil, Mexico and parts of Europe. It doesn't take a business school degree to know that pricing power is important and indicative of the durability of a brand.Demand for Netflix's high quality English-language content remains strong. The international business doesn't require much capital investment to scale across new markets, reducing that expansion risk significantly. Simply put, the risk/reward is very much in NFLX's favor. Given the size and growth profile of the international markets, there is huge value for NFLX to continue investing in them.With a &quot;strong slate of global content in the second half of the year,&quot; it's reasonable to expect a year of record annual paid net adds. Netflix Stock and the Virtuous CycleAs Netflix increases its content budget and their marketing strategies become more efficient, they can get more subscribers to the service. More global subscribers who are more engaged means richer valuation for Netflix stock.As of the most recent quarter, Netflix has hit nearly 150m paid members. With continued success in programming and a large global addressable market that can absorb new competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's a risky proposition to bet against the primary disruptor of linear television.

2169,4341,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fitbit-stock-poised-least-104011688.html?.tsrc=rss,Why Fitbit Stock Is Poised to at Least Double by 2021,2019-05-08,"Fitbit (NASDAQ: FIT) reported stronger than expected first quarter results on May 1. In addition to meaningfully beating top line and bottom line expectations, the results included multiple, other items that are tremendously positive for Fitbit stock.Source: Fitbit The company's revenue rose 10% year-over-year, its tracker revenue rose YoY for the first time in three years, its smartwatch revenue soared 117% YoY, and the revenue it obtains from companies and insurers jumped 70% YoY.Furthermore, FIT did not raise its 2019 guidance, but said it was not doing so only because it chose to be &quot;prudent,&quot; a code word for conservative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Tick All the Boxes  A Closer Look at FITStill, Fitbit stock fell meaningfully, as investors chose to focus on the few negative aspects of the company's results, including lower average selling prices and conservative Q2 guidance.I believe that these investors are making the classic mistake of focusing on the trees instead of the forest. That's because I think that FIT has a tremendous monetization opportunity that will enable Fitbit stock to at least double over the next year or two. Fitbit's strategy for monetizing its users on a massive level is becoming clear.FIT CEO James Park reported that a large study of diabetes prevention methods found that people who used Fitbit devices, &quot;were more active and lost more weight during the program than those who did not and were more likely to be engaged in the platform a year later.&quot;Additionally, subjects who used Fitbit devices averaged an hour more activity per week for much of the program than those who did not, he stated.Clearly, people who use step-tracking devices are more active and, consequently, less like to have diabetes, heart disease and some forms of cancer than those who do not use such devices.As I've written previously, insurers and employers have tremendous incentive to keep their employees and clients healthier.As a result, they will likely be willing to pay meaningful amounts of money to do so. Opportunities Abound for FitbitFitbit is already taking advantage of this opportunity on multiple fronts. Many Medicare Advantage programs, spread around 27 states, are covering Fitbit devices, Park reported. Furthermore, three national health plans are currently using Fitbit Care as their means for diabetes management. &quot;There's a lot of interest (among insurers) in our Fitbit Care product,&quot; Park said. With Fitbit Care, the company analyzes patients' data it obtains from its own devices as well as other devices. and uses that data to offer patients ways of improving their health. In the second half of this year, FIT plans to launch a premium offering for individuals based on Fitbit Care. I believe that, over time, Fitbit Care will be adopted by many employers, health insurers, and individuals. As everyone knows, obesity is a major problem in the U.S. and leads to tremendous health problems. Under the principle that &quot;what gets measured gets managed,&quot; step-tracking devices definitely help people become more active.  Employers and  health insurers have a financial interest in keeping their employees and clients healthy. And individuals, of course,  have many reasons to want to be healthier and avoid obesity, and Americans already spend a great deal of time  and money seeking to accomplish those goals. Therefore, I believe that there's a tremendous addressable market for Fitbit's devices, encompassing both enterprises and individuals. If FIT can obtain a sizable piece of that  market, FIT's results and FIT stock will definitely rise tremendously over the long-term.  Fitbit Stock and the Monetization WarFitbit is in a &quot;sweet spot&quot; that will allow it to become the leader of this huge addressable market. The smartwatches sold by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) are too expensive for most enterprises and many people who want to use step trackers to improve their health. At the same time, many enterprises and people will not be ready to trust Chinese companies who sell cheaper step trackers, but don't have well-respected brand names,  with the important task of helping themselves or their clients/employees improve their health. That leaves Fitbit and Samsung as the remaining options, and FIT's devices already meaningfully outsell those of Samsung, giving FIT an important advantage over its Korean competitor. I was disappointed that FIT did not make any new announcements regarding its devices' ability to diagnose diseases or take measurements that are crucial for individuals' health, such as blood oxygen levels or sleep apnea. In the past, I have said that Fitbit must make positive strides in those areas for FIT stock to rally. Still, the company noted that it was continuing to work with the FDA to &quot;test and develop&quot; those types of solutions, and I recognize that it takes a long time to get the agency to approve devices. More importantly, I'm now convinced that, over the next year or two, monetizing Fitbit Care will prove to be a tremendous, positive catalyst for FIT's results and FIT stock., enabling Fitbit stock to at least double during that time As of this writing, the author owned shares of FIT stock.

Back in January, Apple, Inc. (AAPL â Research Report) CEO Tim Cook dialed back the guidance on the companyâs Q1 earnings in a clever pre-emptive damage control move that simultaneously acknowledged declining sales revenue, lowered the earnings bar, and set the stage to meet or exceed that bar. In a classic example of Appleâs long game, Cook accepted a hit to the stock value early, in order to ameliorate the damage later. When Appleâs Q1 report turned out OK in light of the carefully managed expectations, the stage was set for last weekâs Q2 beat.Itâs fair to say that Tim Cookâs gambit has paid off. In April 30âs Q2 report, Apple met or exceeded expectations that were set at the end of Q1. The Q2 report justified managementâs announcement earlier this year of a shift in focus toward services and user base monetization strategies. Weâll look at the news, and then dive into TipRanksâ analyst database to see what Wall Street has to say. Crunching Some NumbersFirst the headline numbers. Apple reported earnings of $2.46 per share, beating the forecast by 4%. Revenues came in 1% over the expectation, at $58 billion. Total revenues were down 5% from the year-ago quarter, but Cook primed us for that earlier this year. Investors shrugged it off, apparently, as AAPL shares jumped 5% after the Q2 earnings release.We can break down Appleâs revenues by segment, for a better look at where the company is heading. iPhone revenues, at $31.05 billion, were down 17% from last yearâs Q2, and the Mac revenue of $5.51 billion also showed a decline. That was the bad news. Other segments were up, however, with gains that equaled or beat iPhoneâs decline.The Services segment, on which Apple is staking its future, is up 16% to $11.45 billion quarterly revenues, iPad sales were up 19% to the segmentâs best performance in 6 years, and the Wearables segment (which includes other accessories) showed a whopping 50% jump to $5.13 billion. While these gains did not fully offset the loss in iPhone revenue â the smartphones are, by sheer numbers, still Appleâs premier product and count for over 53% of total revenues â the pattern of gains and losses clearly shows how Apple is right to shift focus from the maturing iPhone market to the still-expanding Services, iPad, and Wearables.  Time to Monetize the BaseTim Cook stated that path clearly in his statements on the earnings: âOur March quarter results show the continued strength of our installed base of over 1.4 billion active devices, as we set an all-time record for Services, and the strong momentum of our Wearables, Home and Accessories categoryâ¦ We delivered our strongest iPad growth in six years, and we are as excited as ever about our pipeline of innovative hardware, software, and services.âThis is all consistent with the âShow Timeâ event that Cook hosted six weeks ago. The event â in effect, the flip side to early Januaryâs guidance revision â introduced us to Appleâs overarching strategy to cope with both the maturing smartphone market and the possibility of economic slowdown in China, and the reduced iPhone sales that both portend. In short, itâs time for Apple to monetize the user base. Keep your eyes open this summer and fall; Apple will be releasing its Apple News+, Apple Card, AppleTV+, and Apple Arcade services. New models for the core products in the Mac and iPad lines have also been announced, and the company is developing to wireless earphone in the Wearables department. iPhone development will continue, but expect new products to release at a slower pace better suited to a 3- to 5-year replacement cycle.  Top Analysts AgreeMarket analysts agree that Apple shares are a buying prospect. Writing from Argus Research, five-star analyst Jim Kelleher (Track Record & Ratings) raised his price target by 11%, from $225 to $250. The new price target suggests an 18% upside potential to AAPL shares. Kelleher specifically pointed out âAppleâs high Services revenue in the quarter and the surge in its contribution from Wearables & Home segment.â He also noted the boost in confidence provided by âmanagement's capital return program after Apple's expanded buyback and increased dividend announcements.âThe capital return program cited by Kelleher was summed up by company CFO Luca Maestri: âGiven our confidence in Appleâs future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, weâre also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount.â Since initiating dividend payments in 2012, Apple has made a consistent policy of rewarding shareholders. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva (Track Record & Ratings) also gave a bullish review of AAPL stock, saying, âSimply put Appleâs results and outlook across most metrics were clearly better than expected. As a result, both our and consensus estimates will move slightly higherâ¦â Suvaâs stance is less aggressive than Kelleherâs, and his price target of $220 indicates a more modest 4% upside.Since May 1, Apple has received 13 buy ratings from Wall Streetâs best rated analysts as opposed to 10 holds, giving the stock a âModerate Buyâ consensus rating. AAPL shares sell for $211 and have an average price target of $218; this gives the stock a modest, but real, upside of 3.26%.  This upside is in line with the stockâs recent history â it is important to bear in mind that as AAPLâs share price has risen quickly in recent months, it has developed a pattern of outpacing the analystsâ price targets.View AAPL Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail A Solid Smart ScoreThe buy ratings and price targets indicate a modestly bullish future for Apple, but they are not the only positive indicators. The TipRanks Smart Score brings together all of the data into one package, focusing on eight factors that are known to indicate future success. Apple gives us a particularly good example of the Smart Score in use, as it shows that a company need not have perfect ratings to achieve a high score. AAPL shares hold a Smart Score of 8, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market. Letâs break it down.On the debit side, we find that both insiders and investors have been selling Apple. A closer look shows that insider holdings are only down $255K in the last three months, while AAPLâs decline in investment portfolios is only 1%; while in the red, these numbers may also be indicative of profit taking as the stock has risen in recent weeks. Hedge fund activity presents a stronger negative on this stock.Turning to the credit side, we find plenty to outweigh the debits and give Apple its âOutperformâ rating.  We have already discussed the analyst consensus; the blogger and news sentiment are similarly bullish. Apple has been receiving great press, with 84% of the top financial bloggers and 82% of the news coverage giving a positive outlook. The final categories are the technicals and fundamentals, two different modes of stock analysis. On the technical side, the moving averages are trending up, giving a positive rating, while the one-year momentum shows AAPL shares up 20%. For the fundamentals, Appleâs 49% return on equity is clearly the key factor.View AAPL Smart Score Details Looking AheadApple takes an optimistic view of its near future, seeing revenues of $52.5 to $54.5 billion, with predicted gross margins of 37 to 38%. The company faces a serious challenge â lower sales in its flagship iPhone line â but has articulated a clear plan to meet it and initial results look promising. On a fundamental level, Apple still has those 1.4 billion active devices sold, translating to a loyal user base more than 1 billion strong.The TipRanks data shows that Apple management is right to be optimistic. A variety of indicators â from the human to the technical â point toward this stock outperforming the market. Enjoy the Research Report on the Stock in this Article:Apple, Inc.

Nokia stock fell by 10% after its quarterly report. Traders sold NOK amid earnings and revenue misses. Investors keep waiting for the predicted increase in revenue and earnings brought about by the rise of 5G. This latest report leaves many wondering if it will ever happen.Source: Shutterstock As a result, many see some of Nokia's peers as better investments. However, despite the struggles, a buy case for a specific type of investor remains. Lost Confidence and Nokia stockTo be sure, NOK stock has become a frustrating equity. I had taken a bullish on Nokia due to 5G. However, the latest earnings report has forced me to admit that the profit rollout has come more slowly than expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin wonders if those profits will ever appear. He believes Nokia suffers because of a trust problem within the Finland-based company.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May He may be right.Nokia has kept its guidance steady for both 2019 and 2020. But that also leaves investors wondering if 5G profits will actually start coming in the second half of the year.Nokia has missed opportunities since at least 2007. At that time, this leading cellphone company failed to see the future. As a result, it saw its business quickly evaporate soon after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its iPhone.Also, as Martin correctly points out, the merger with Alcatel-Lucent has met with declines in Nokia stock. The stock suffered further in March when the company revealed that some transactions with the Alcatel-Lucent division faced compliance issues.To its credit, NOK has transformed itself into a 5G equipment provider. However, it seems to lack the drive to succeed in its new industry. Political pressures have all but eliminated Huawei as an option in many countries. Unfortunately for investors in Nokia stock, the company has not benefitted from the reduced competition. Nokia Is Falling BehindOn the other hand, eliminating a major rival has boosted Ericsson's (NASDAQ:ERIC) numbers. Ericsson stock rose by 7.3% after it announced an earnings and revenue beat in its last quarterly report.Its 17.8 forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio comes in higher. Still, that appears cheap in light of expected profit growth of more than 272% this year and a predicted 31.7% earnings increase in 2020.It also lags firms such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in other areas of networking. Double-digit profit growth, a 16.4 forward PE ratio, and the track record of dividend increases make Cisco a viable option. Dividend Investors and Nokia StockDespite these metrics from its peers, I see a case for buying Nokia stock, at least for dividend investors. The 24-cent per share annual dividend yields about 4.6% at current prices.Given the expected demand for 5G, I do not see Nokia's financials warranting a dividend cut. Moreover, it surpasses Cisco's yield of around 2.6% as well as Ericsson's which comes in at about 1.2%. The payout also gives investors some return even if it remains rangebound.Furthermore, Nokia's forward PE comes in at about 13. If it fulfills some of its potential as a 5G equipment provider, profits should finally rise. That could take it above $7 per share, a price level it has not surpassed since 2015. Concluding Thoughts on Nokia StockAmid the struggles, the buy case for Nokia remains lucrative for dividend investors. Nokia's latest earnings and revenue miss confirmed some long-held negative feelings about NOK stock.In recent weeks, compliance issues have weighed on NOK. Moreover, missing on revenue and earnings even with less competition has many investors perplexed. This has arguably made a case for investors to choose Ericsson or Cisco over Nokia.Nonetheless, Nokia leads its peers by a wide margin on dividend yields. Moreover, the rise of 5G will likely push NOK higher despite itself. Even if Nokia fails to produce stellar earnings reports, the cash payouts should keep dividend investors happy for the foreseeable future.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

It has since been updated and republished.]There's an old saying in the financial services business that it's better to buy a company's stock than a company's products if you genuinely want to become wealthy. That's because the products are designed to make the company money, not you. A tad cynical, perhaps, but a recent study brought to my attention makes me realize there's more to the idea then meets the eye. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYears ago, when I first started writing about investing, I developed a concept I called &quot;Everyday Investing,&quot; an idea borrowed from Peter Lynch's belief that investors should buy what they know. Ironically, in one of my articles about Everyday Investing in 2012, I mentioned General Electric (NYSE:GE). We all know how that turned out. However, the financial education site Simple. Thrifty. Living. has done a study that demonstrates how far ahead we'd be if we chose to take the money we would have spent on a newly launched product we just had to have and invested those funds in the company instead.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives The study took 35 companies and figured out how much you would have made if you invested in their stock instead of buying their product or service. It found that in only four cases: GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Sony (NYSE:SNE), Pandora (acquired), HBO - AT&T (NYSE:T) -- you would have lost money.Interestingly, the study breaks down the 35 companies into seven areas: Technology, Food & Drink, Retail, Automotive, Entertainment, Streaming, and Banking. I'll pick one from each whose products I love.In five to 10 years you'll be better off owning their stocks rather than their products. The numbers bear this out.Source:  Yuanbin Du Via Flickr Technology: Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)Although I said I'd only pick one stock from each category, I'd be negligent in my duties if I didn't do everything in my power to convince readers that owning Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the responsible thing to do. I have written before about why investors were asking the wrong question when it comes to the two behemoth tech stocks. Rather than decide which is the better stock, I argued the better question is, why don't you want to own both stocks?At the end of a long day at work, Apple and Microsoft's businesses are not going to keep you from sleeping at night. Together, the two companies have $94 billion in free cash flow, suggesting that all of the capital allocation levers they choose to pull are available to them. Sure, Apple's innovation cycle is lengthening, while its iPhone sales are slowing, but Tim Cook is more than capable of guiding the ship through uncharted territory.Between Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, you might have two of America's best CEOs. Owning both, in my opinion, is the far smarter play.Source: Shutterstock  Food & Drink: Starbucks (SBUX)It seems like only a short time ago that investors were fretting Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) had lost its edge without Howard Schultz at the helm. Well, since CEO Kevin Johnson took the top job on April 3, 2017, SBUX stock is up 32%.Over two years that might not seem like a lot, but given many were calling for the company's demise without Schultz running the company, it's pretty darn good. Johnson's had to make some tough calls like slowing the rate of store openings for its higher-end Reserve and Roastery stores. It's not as easy as it sounds to pivot away from Schultz's growth plans, but it shows that Johnson's not afraid to do things differently to deliver for employees and shareholders.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 Cowen analyst Andrew Charles believes Starbucks could be the first big restaurant chain to introduce CBD-infused drinks into its offerings.&quot;The dynamics are fluid, likely delaying adoption from major coffee players like Starbucks in the near term,&quot; Cowan analyst Andrew Charles wrote in February. &quot;Should the regulation of CBD oil as an additive to food/beverage change or craft/independent coffee shops find a way to comply with the existing regulation, we could envision Starbucks ultimately piloting the ingredient.&quot;When it comes to innovation and giving its customers what they want, Starbucks is easily at the front of the class. This alone makes SBUX stock a long-term buy.Source: Shutterstock  Retail: Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is in a bit of slump in 2019. Year to date it's up around 10%. To put that in perspective, Amazon has had annual total returns of more than 25% in seven of the last 10 years. That's great news if you want to own its stock, because given all the projects it has going on, it's not going to stay below $2,000 for very long. Heck, I believe it won't be too long before it hits $10,000.  &quot;Nothing Amazon does surprises me anymore. It's got a great business model and is using technology to innovate old-school industries like grocery, convenience stores, healthcare -- the list goes on,&quot; I wrote in February. &quot;I could actually see Amazon stock hit $10,000 within five years.&quot;I'll grant you that most predictions (including my own) are as cheap as the paper or screen they were written on. That said, Jeff Bezos continues to deliver for shareholders. Until that stops being the case, AMZN is a must-own retail stock.Source: Shutterstock  Automotive: Tesla (TSLA)According to the Wall Street Journal, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was the 34th most shorted stock on Nasdaq as of April 15 at 34.4 million shares. However, that's just 21.11% of its float, putting it nowhere near 29.7% of the float needed to qualify for a spot in the Nasdaq's top 50 by that metric. Needless to say, if I had a dollar for every piece of negative TSLA sentiment in the media, I'd be a wealthy man. Of course, some would say the opposite is equally true, given how many boosters are out there. Recently, TSLA shares were lower after the SEC asked a judge to hold the Tesla CEO in contempt for violating his settlement deal with the securities regulator.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer thinks Musk should be removed as CEO. I'm of two minds on this subject. On the one hand, I couldn't imagine anyone but Musk driving this company higher. On the other, Musk would be far more productive if he wasn't micro-managing the entire business, instead getting some sleep, and letting his executives do their jobs.   I could easily see Tesla succeeding with Musk as Executive Chairman and a new person in the CEO role. I would be hard to find someone willing to step into such a position given the level of executive attrition, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. If you can only own one money-losing company (fiscal year), Tesla has got to be it.Source: Baron Valium via Flickr Entertainment: Disney (DIS)In the study mentioned at the beginning, it uses Wall-E, Disney's (NYSE:DIS) 2008 animated film about a robot, as the product in question. You'll notice that the &quot;Launch Retail Price&quot; for the five products in the entertainment category are all $7.18. That's because the study most likely used the average ticket price in 2008 as the starting point for determining how much a consumer would have made by taking a pass on the movie and investing those funds in Disney stock. Back then, Disney stock was trading just under $30. Today, it's nearly $140, an annualized return of more than 14%. It's not a spectacular return over a decade, but it's not terrible either. Of all the stocks on this list, Disney is the most difficult to handicap. It has got a lot of great assets, but investors continue to worry that it has missed the boat when it comes to streaming. InvestorPlace contributor Will Healy feels the potential for Disney stock begins and ends with Disney+, the company's soon-to-be-launched streaming service.&quot;Much like the decline of the Disney channel hampered DIS, a successful Disney+ launch could resume the growth of DIS,&quot; Healy wrote recently. &quot;Investors have priced both the successes and challenges in most of Disney's divisions into the price of DIS stock.&quot;While a lot is riding on Disney+, shareholders ought to be thankful for how well units like the hotels and resorts are performing. There's a lot more going on at Disney than just figuring out streaming.Source: Vivian D Nguyen via Flickr (Modified) Streaming: Netflix (NFLX)If I were forced to own a stock that some consider a one-trick pony, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would have to be it.Sure, the world's largest streaming service does nothing else but sell monthly subscriptions to customers who binge watch an outrageous amount of TV, but if it is a one-trick pony, I can't think of a better example in modern history. I've been a fan of NFLX stock for some time because it continues to grow its subscriber base. Of course, there are lots of companies that consistently grow their subscriber base. What makes Netflix so great in my mind is the fact that it also continues to grow the operating profit per subscriber.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards In January, I reminded investors that since the beginning of 2017, Netflix has more than doubled its operating profit per subscriber to $14.18 as of the end of September. In the final quarter of the year, Netflix had 139.26 million subscribers and $1.6 billion in operating profits (about $280 million lower than my estimate for the September quarter) for an operating profit of $11.49 per subscriber.Ok, so Netflix has only increased its operating profit per subscriber over the last 24 months by 62% from $7.07 at the end of 2017, to $11.49 at the end of 2018.A traditional movie theater would kill for this kind of increase.Source: Shutterstock  Banking: JPMorgan (JPM)There are only two stocks to pick from in the banking category: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Both are pretty good choices. However, because JPM is purely a bank, I think it makes sense to go with Jamie Dimon's baby. Interestingly, while many banks are closing branches, JPMorgan is opening them. In January, the bank said that it would have a branch network in place by 2022 that will cover 93% of the country's population. That expansion will see it increase its footprint by 80 million people over five years. Why is this bank adding branches while others are closing them?JPM has found that most of its new customers switch banks because it has convenient branch locations. Furthermore, the company's growth in deposits has come almost exclusively from people who visit branches frequently. I guess it's not the bank for millennials. However, that's not to say it isn't trying. Last year, it launched Finn by Chase to attract those interested in mobile banking. The app has some useful features including helping you save automatically, track your spending, and even figure out what purchases make you the happiest.   I think it'a safe to say that like most products put out by the biggest banks, they're decent, if not spectacular. It's not my favorite bank, but long-term, I don't think Jamie Dimon will steer you wrong. As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It has since been updated and republished by InvestorPlace staff.]A strong balance sheet can and should be a key part of the bull case for a stock. Modest -- or zero -- debt lowers risk. And excess cash can be used for shareholder returns, M&A or growth opportunities while, in some cases, putting a protective floor under the stock.Of late, even in major stocks, investors have seen the importance of the balance sheet. Consumer giants Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) have seen their equity values plunge after loading up on debt. AT&T (NYSE:T) hasn't shown the same downside, but its record levels of debt threaten its dividend and likely have kept on lid on T stock in recent years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo cash-rich stocks offer some value, but not without their own downside. Companies that keep significant amounts of excess cash aren't putting that cash to work or allowing their shareholders to do the same. Debt can cause big downside if a business stumbles. Conversely, it can also lever returns higher if management strategies succeed.  * 10 Oversold Stocks to Run From As always, there's no simple way to find the best stocks to buy among these names. But for investors who look for cash-rich stocks, these 15 fit the bill. All have big cash balances that can be put to use and little or zero debt. Those balance sheets provide plenty of options for management and, hopefully, potential moves that can boost shareholder value. Cash-Rich Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source: Apple Outside of banks, it's likely no other company in history has had more cash than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does right now. The company closed its fiscal first quarter with $245 billion in cash and investments. (Editor's note: Look for Apple to report Q2 earnings April 30 after the market close.)The question is what Apple plans to do with all its cash. Investors continue to clamor for a big acquisition, particularly with the company's emphasis on growing its Services business. But that historically hasn't been Apple's style: its biggest buy ever was the $3 billion deal for Beats Music back in August 2014.That may change: earlier this year, Luke Lango detailed seven potential M&A targets for Apple, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Either way, however, Apple will spend its $130 billion net cash in some way, as management disclosed early last year. That will likely include aggressive dividend increases - and almost certainly additional share repurchases. Apple spent $73 billion on buybacks last year, another $8 billion-plus in Q1.The question is whether that windfall -- or M&A -- will be enough. I wrote last month that I'm still skeptical toward the pivot to services, with iPhone revenues likely to decline as pricing power maxes out. But AAPL is cheap, and management has plenty of tools at its disposal to try and move the stock higher. Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS)Source: Shutterstock Power products manufacturer Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS) has an interesting bull case at the moment. AEIS stock has dropped by about 30% from early June highs, due largely to worries about the semiconductor manufacturers it services.As a result, AEIS looks rather cheap, at 10x 2020 EPS estimates. But the company also has some $9 per share in cash -- which makes AEIS even cheaper. Excluding that hoard, AEIS trades at barely 8x next year's consensus.Admittedly, this is a cyclical stock. And many companies in the chip space keep cash on the balance sheet to ensure they can manage through a downturn. Still, Advanced Energy seems to have some dry powder here. Cash has risen by over $200 million in the last five years.  * 10 Stocks to Sell Before They Give Back 2019 Gains On the Q4 call, meanwhile, CFO Paul Oldham said the company would &quot;use our strong cash position to pursue new growth opportunities and expand our addressable market.&quot; That could signal a willingness for M&A -- and putting that cash to work might make AEIS even cheaper. Netgear (NTGR)Source: Shutterstock The story at Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) has been frustrating of late, to say the least. The spinoff of Arlo Technologies (NYSE:ARLO) has been an unmitigated disaster. Margins have seen pressure recently. To top it off, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquired &quot;mesh network&quot; provider and Netgear competitor Eero last month.But I haven't given up on Netgear just yet. Its router business still is hanging in there. Dominant market share in switches provides a stable profit base. And Amazon historically hasn't been successful in hardware â¦ sure, Echo has been a success, but failed with the Fire Stick and Fire Phone, among other efforts.One reason I'm still long NTGR stock is the company's cash balance. Netgear closed 2018 with $273 million in cash and investments -- nearly a quarter of its market cap. That dry powder is likely to be used for M&A, which could grow earnings. At less than 15x 2019 EPS estimates, an accretive deal can make NTGR cheap again. And it could jumpstart a rally that erases at least some of the disappointment of the last year. Facebook (FB)Source: Shutterstock Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has seen a nice rally so far this year, gaining some 35%. Controversy still swirls around the company, but investors seem at least a bit more confident than they were at the end of 2018.At the end of the day, Facebook stock is going to come down to how users feel, not investors. But in the meantime, the company has quite a bit of cash to play with. Facebook ended 2018 with $41 billion in cash -- and no long-term debt.It's not entirely clear what Facebook plans to do with the cash -- or what it can do. A major acquisition probably doesn't make a lot of sense. Last year, the company used most of its impressive free cash flow for buybacks. The company generated $17.7 billion in free cash flow and spent almost three-quarters as much repurchasing stock.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt At an average price of $163 (according to figures from the 10-K), that effort has been accretive so far. And it should continue well into 2019. Investors who believe FB still is cheap can at least know that Facebook itself will be buying shares as well. Bassett Furniture (BSET)Source: Mike Mozard via FlickrIt has been a struggle of late for Bassett Furniture (NASDAQ:BSET). Torrid growth in the first few years of the decade has slowed to a crawl. Retail sales declined in fiscal 2018 (ending November) for the first time since 2011. And BSET stock touched a four-year low earlier this month before rebounding modestly in recent sessions.But, with BSET stock off near-20% so far in 2019, there's an intriguing &quot;buy the dip&quot; case here. The company should be able to work through disruption from tariffs and higher input costs. There's still room to expand its footprint in retail, as that segment has turned from a loss leader to a modest profit center.And Bassett still has a rock-solid balance sheet. It closed FY18 with over $55 million in cash and investments -- roughly 30% of its market cap. The company paid special dividends back in 2015 and 2016 and could do so again. Meanwhile, backing out that cash, BSET trades at about 13x earnings, with those earnings down sharply from recent levels.There's tons of upside to BSET if the company can execute a turnaround. That's a big &quot;if,&quot; and it requires some macro help as well. But the balance sheet gives Bassett time and it buys BSET stock some downside protection. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: Shutterstock Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another tech giant with an enormous cash hoard. The company has over $101 billion in cash and only about $4 billion in long-term debt.It's less clear what Alphabet's plans are. The company's expanding reach beyond search gives it a wealth of potential M&A targets. It wouldn't be a total shock if the company decided to put more capital behind its Waymo self-driving car program. The company could try to move into content. And it has made moves into hardware, most notably with its purchase of Nest.  * 7 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for Sunny Long-Term Returns Here, too, the cash does color the valuation of the stock. GOOGL already looks cheap, at 23x forward earnings. If you exclude the cash hoard, the forward multiple dips under 20x. There are some reasons for the low multiple, including pressure on the search business, but Alphabet has a literal wealth of options at its disposal going forward. Guess? (GES)Source: Shutterstock Plenty of retailers have good amounts of cash on the balance sheet. But Guess? (NYSE:GES) combines a fortress balance sheet with an intriguing bull case.At the moment, it doesn't look like Guess? has that much to play with. Net cash for financing activities at the end of its fourth quarter increased from $139 million to $211 million, as inventory builds ahead of the key holiday season reversed.Meanwhile, growth looks impressive. The company is managing positive same-store sales in the Americas. But the real opportunity is overseas. GES is performing exceedingly well in Europe, and has a huge growth opportunity in Asia.Backing out that cash, GES trades at under 17x forward EPS -- an intriguing multiple. For investors who want international exposure and a strong balance sheet, GES should be at the top of the list. Dolby Laboratories (DLB)Source: Sony Dolby Laboratories (NYSE:DLB) offers an interesting combination of value and growth. $12 per share in cash on the balance sheet provides some downside protection -- and fuel for growth. New initiatives like Dolby Cinema, Dolby Voice and Dolby Vision are growing quickly, with guidance for the three categories to increase sales 30%-50% in fiscal 2019 (ending September).The story isn't perfect. Some of the cash probably could be spent with no real harm to Dolby. Family control of the company may limit distributions (for tax reasons). And valuation isn't as cheap as Dolby's non-GAAP numbers suggest, as stock-based compensation is rather high.  * 7 Red-Hot E-Commerce Stocks to Consider Still, there's a nice base in royalty revenue, huge margins and growth potential. With DLB stock still off the highs, there could be nice upside here going forward -- with less risk than the rest of the market. Fitbit (FIT)Source: Shutterstock To be sure, I'm not a fan of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) as a stock. I recommended investors sell FIT stock ahead of earnings last quarter, and indeed disappointing guidance undercut a recent rally. (Ed's note: Fitbit will report first-quarter earnings May 1.)But I'll admit other investors can see it differently. Fitbit could be an acquisition target at some point, with a buyer looking to slash overhead costs and increase distribution. And few stocks in the market have the same amount of cash as Fitbit. At the end of 2018, Fitbit had $723 million in cash and investments -- almost half its market cap of about $1.5 billion.At the least, Fitbit has plenty of time to turn its operations around. Adjusted EBITDA still is guided to flat to negative this year, so there's work left to do. But patient investors might see Fitbit as worth the wait -- with the cash providing a potential floor, even if operations take a turn for the worse. Amtech Systems (ASYS)Source: Shutterstock It does seem like micro-cap equipment manufacturer Amtech Systems (NASDAQ:ASYS) simply can't fall any further. Around $6.57, its market cap sits at $93 million (ASYS was at $72 million when this article was last published). But Amtech has some $56 million in unrestricted cash -- and just $8 million in debt. Its tangible book value is just shy of $7 per share.The problem is that ASYS has been a value favorite off and on for years now -- and historically disappoints. Its exposure to solar markets leads to huge upcycles: ASYS touched $25 in early 2011, cleared $10 in 2014 and 2015, and was at $15 less than eighteen months ago. The downturns, however, usually send investors fleeing.  * 7 Red-Hot E-Commerce Stocks to Consider At this point, however, there's an intriguing case to buy the dip. Business remains relatively weak, but the stock is cheap. $4-plus generally has held as support for most of the decade. And Amtech can use the cash sheet to make another acquisition or wait out another downturn. At the least, value investors should take a long look. American Software (AMSWA)Source: Shutterstock Shares of American Software (NASDAQ:AMSWA) have plunged in recent months for one key reason. The ERP (enterprise resource planning) and SCM (supply chain management) software developer tried to change the narrative surrounding the stock by focusing on a shift from license revenue to SaaS (software-as-a-service) billing.The problem is that it looks like management oversold the shift. License revenue was only a small part of the business -- and overall growth has decelerated sharply in recent quarters. As a result, AMSWA has pulled back to past levels  -- and unsurprisingly so.But after the sell-off, AMSWA does look a bit more attractive. Income investors can be enticed by a 3.8% yield. The company has over 20% of its market capitalization in cash. The run-up certainly went too far. But back at current levels, there's enough here to get interested again. 1-800-Flowers (FLWS)Source: Kazandrew via FlickrThe case for 1-800-Flowers.com (NASDAQ:FLWS) is that the next five years will look like the past five. 1-800-Flowers.com has crushed rival FTD Companies (NASDAQ:FTD) in pretty much every way. That's most obvious when looking at the respective stock prices. Over the past five years, FLWS stock has gained 236%. FTD has lost 98.6% of its value.There's still plenty of room for FLWS to gain more market share. On the one hand, FTD is reeling, having swapped out management and struggling under a heavily leveraged balance sheet. FLWS, on the other hand, is operating on all cylinders.  * 7 Small-Cap Growth ETFs For Adventurous Investors And its balance sheet could provide another catalyst. The company has $258 million in cash and only $87 million in debt. That gives 1-800-Flowers.com to ability to either drive share repurchases or look to acquisitions. The 2014 acquisition of Harry & David is a clear winner that expanded the company's gift business. FLWS could look for another winner -- or simply buy back more shares. As long as it keeps dominating its space, investors should be fine either way. Adams Resources (AE)Few stocks in the market have the balance sheet that Adams Resources (NYSEAMERICAN:AE) does. Adams has nearly $28 per share in cash in the bank -- and zero debt.To be fair, Adams needs quite a bit of cash for its marketing business, in which it buys vast amounts of oil from drillers and resells it at a modest profit to refiners. But at this point, a good chunk of the cash is excess, and Adams may finally be ready to put it to work. The company's trucking business is showing signs of life amid a nationwide shortage, and after one small acquisition in that business, Adams could look to build it out further.Expecting huge returns here may be too much to ask, admittedly. But at $38, Adams trades at only a modest premium to book value while there is some upside potential here. A 2.3% dividend helps -- and so does the fortress balance sheet. AXT (AXTI)Source: Shutterstock AXT (NASDAQ:AXTI) manufactures substrates used in semiconductor production, and so it's little surprise AXTI shares have pulled back of late. The stock is down 45% over the past year.But the declines may have gone too far. AXTI still has about $1 per share in cash against a share price just over $4. Price-to-book-value sits at about 0.9x.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Are $6 or Less Like Amtech, cycles are brutal. And like Amtech, a strong balance sheet suggests that the selloff may have gone too far. BlackBerry (BB)Source: Shutterstock BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) seems almost forgotten at this point. It's not terribly hard to see why. The company once dominated the smartphone space, but it has long since exited the business altogether. Meanwhile, BB stock has traded basically sideways for about seven years now. Investors clearly have lost patience, and interest: average daily volume in the stock is at decade-long lows.But there is an interesting case for BB at the moment. The company used a big chunk of its cash balance to acquire artificial intelligence company Cylance. It still should have about $800 million left -- well over $1 per share. The company's QNX software is just one of the potential catalysts for the stock.I've long been a BB skeptic -- but there is a case here. BlackBerry still has dry powder left for another deal, or shareholder returns. And it's possible that investors have stopped paying attention just as the company is entering a new phase.As of this writing, Vince Martin is long shares of NETGEAR and FTD Companies. He has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Even as mighty as it is now there are almost as many analysts who rate the stock as a BUY or HOLD. But none of them have a SELL rating on it, so it is always an opportunity to own Apple stock if you want to hold it long enough.Source: Shutterstock So the right answer lies somewhere in between and totally depends on the investor time frame. The long-term thesis of AAPL is viable for as long as the stock market is a rising investment vehicle. But I also believe in trying to maximize profits wherever and whenever possible from short-term opportunities along the way.First, let's consider the bullish thesis for Apple stock. Year-to-date, it is up 30%, which is almost double that of the S&P 500. In five years it is up 150%, three times the S&P. So clearly the proof is in the pudding as they say.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough I am not a fan of the products for myself, I do respect that they are beautiful and functional. This is a matter of taste as I've always leaned towards PC and Android systems. But what I respect most about AAPL stock is the hold the company has on its clients.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever AAPL clientele is the most dedicated I've ever seen to a company. Price is never a problem for the users, and they gladly admit that they are stuck in its eco-system. Clearly, it has a sustainable advantage.Now for the bad part. What I like the least about Apple stock long term is that its fate is in the hands of Tim Cook. The experts praise him for increasing the value of the company since he took it over. While it's impossible to prove, it is very likely that AAPL stock would have succeeded just the same even without a leader at the helm.And therein lies part of the opportunity today. While Apple is still is a cash generating machine and the stock remains a BUY for a few years to come, I can use it to profit short term. I can snipe technical opportunities under the pretext of a longer thesis.Apple reports earnings at the end of the month. Usually AAPL stock rallies into the event, but after it's a binary reaction to the results. So the opportunity for the trade started the day they announced a settlement with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The Best Way to Approach Apple StockI took advantage of the opportunity intra-day. Apple stock suddenly spiked on volume before the actual announcement. Some on Wall Street knew the news before it happened. I went long the stock and the trade has been a big win already, but it is not done yet.So I will hold my position long into its earnings report. AAPL is likely to spin a positive story from the QCOM settlement. And with the size of its profit and loss statement, they can back it up. Tim Cook has become a spin doctor of late and there is no reason to doubt his promises yet.The consensus is that Apple is lagging in important areas, especially on the transition to 5G. But they will probably guide well enough to reignite hope for the fans. We all know they're going to crush it as they always do. And this time they can even hide any iPhone sales weakness since they no longer report unit sales. This makes it hard for critics to find a single reason to sell the event. The balance sheet and its P&L are large enough that it will be very easy to hide any weaknesses in one particular segment.  * 7 No-Load Mutual Funds to Buy The fundamental reason to own Apple stock is easy. This is the premier company on the planet and it has the financial statements to back it up. And it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14, which is the cheapest of the technology mega caps. The fact that Walt Street doesn't give AAPL stock its due is a tradition, so that alone is not a reason to own it for a specific period of time. Luckily this time, going into the earnings report AAPL also has a short-term technical spark.Last week, AAPL stock triggered a bullish chart pattern that should target $220 per share. While nothing is guaranteed, there is a high chance that it reaches it soon. This either happens going into the earnings, or Tim Cook will surprise investors with a strong report card that would finish this pattern.Today's trade is tactically designed to capture the price action around one event. But also long-term, AAPL is a stock to own, so it will eventually get to my target in case this short-term trigger fails to fill its upside potential on this run.Once AAPL stock crossed the $200 per share zone it triggered a buy signal that should invite buyers of the stock for an additional $20 per share. Along the way, there will be areas of resistance but also open gaps that will be magnetic.It is important to note that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reports first this week and AAPL could move in sympathy with it. This is also be a binary outcome to add to the short-term uncertainty.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

After all, American Express stock is doing just fine, even if it's been quiet.Source: Shutterstock AXP stock did dip sharply in December, but it's recovered those losses. Over the last year, American Express stock has gained nearly 17%, and it has more than doubled in the last three-plus years.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Still, AXP earnings, due to be reported on Thursday morning, do look reasonably important. The outlook of AXP stock still seems somewhat skeptical, if not outright bearish. Investors are worried about its growth and market share. Its Q4 earnings were disappointing, but the market quickly moved on and kept pushing American Express stock higher. Investors may not be so forgiving if AXP earnings are disappointing again on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAXP stock has twice failed to break through resistance at about $113, and the average Street price target for American Express stock of $118 suggests an increase of  just 6% from its current level.A &quot;beat and raise&quot; Q1 would likely cause analysts to raise their price targets on AXP stock, leaving AXP well-positioned to reach new highs. If AXP earnings miss expectations, however,  investors may have concerns  about AXP's growth, causing American Express stock to at best trade sideways, as it has for nearly seven months now.As a result, Thursday's earnings do seem to be important for American Express stock,  and investors should review them closely. Expectations for AXP EarningsWall Street is expecting a moderately slow start to the year for American Express. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate projects just 7.6%  year-over-year, top-line growth, below the company's full-year guidance of 8%-10%. The company's margins are expected to be pretty much flat, and analysts on average expect its earnings per share to come in at $1.98, up 6.5% year-over-year.That, too suggests improvement over the rest of the year. Consensus for 2019 as a whole is modestly above the midpoint of the company's guidance, and projects 11% EPS growth.That's good news for AXP stock. AXP is not exactly in a &quot;no-lose&quot; situation, but analysts already expect its growth to accelerate as the year goes on. An in-line quarter, or even a modest miss, won't necessarily endanger that outlook.On the other hand, if AXP results solidly beat expectations, its outlook may get more interesting.  Under that scenario, American Express will have started the year strongly, and will still have the same room for improvement during the rest of the year. Full-year growth estimates may well get raised, and the earnings multiple assigned to American Express stock can also rise. If that occurs, AXP  can reach new highs. AXP Stock and the Post-Earnings CallThat said, the numbers aren't going to be the only aspect of the release to which investors will pay close attention. American Express re-upped its partnership with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) earlier this month. That was a big win for AmEx, which already had lost co-branding agreements with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).But American Express had to pay up for the win. It was Delta stock that soared on the news, given that its payments from the deal will double in five years. The end results of that negotiation certainly suggests that American Express' edge over rivals Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has narrowed.So investors will have concerns about AXP's cost and market share  Visa and Mastercard simply are growing faster than AmEx. And the main concern about American Express - and the reason AXP stock is so much cheaper than V and MA - is that at some point, its earnings simply are going to stall out. The entrance of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the space only adds to those worries.There likely will be some questions about the Delta deal  and the kind of returns American Express expects on the resulting $3 billion-plus increase in annual spending. Analysts will want management's take on the Apple Card as well. AmEx needs to answer those questions well, and it needs to convince analysts and investors that its place in the credit-card industry is secure. Be Careful With American Express StockAll told, AXP's Q1 results do seem  poised to change the outlook of AXP stock. A beat-and-raise quarter will suggest that AXP's growth remains intact, making the 12.4  forward, price-earnings multiple of AXP stock seem awfully cheap. Any weakness - whether in the company's results or its guidance - will cause investors to ask if fears about AXP's growth are reasonable.That doesn't mean AXP stock is going to move 10% or more on Thursday; AXP simply isn't that type of stock. Rather, AXP's Q1 earnings could shape how American Express stock trades over the next two months  and determine whether AXP stock can finally break through resistance.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

However, that success -- and the rapidly growing wireless earbud market -- is bringing out competitors. The latest tech giant to be making a play for the AirPods' market is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which is reportedly working on what may end up being named &quot;Surface Buds.&quot;Source: Microsoft Consumer demand for wireless earbuds has been growing, helped by the trend started by Apple of eliminating the headphone jack in smartphones. It's expected to hit $10 billion by 2023. That being said, the big upside for Microsoft stock isn't just the potential revenue in play by selling Surface Buds, it's also something much bigger. Microsoft Working on Surface Buds Wireless EarbudsThurrott, a website known for breaking MSFT product news, is reporting that the company is currently working on a new product with the code-name &quot;Morrison.&quot; InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAccording to Thurrott's multiple un-named sources, Morrison is a set of wireless earbuds that may end up being called Surface Buds when released (potentially in 2019). They are expected to have Cortana onboard, and could incorporate advanced capabilities like noise cancellation and tech that's described as a way to &quot;improve interactions between a phone and the earbuds to make reading content easier on the phone.&quot; Whatever that last feature actually is (and whether it makes it into the production version), the core concept should sound pretty familiar by now: The so-called Surface Buds are aimed squarely at Apple's AirPods.  * 10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now If the idea of MSFT making earbuds seems farfetched, remember that last fall the company launched Surface Headphones. These are premium priced ($349.99) wireless headphones with active noise cancellation, touch controls and -- most importantly -- Cortana on board.That's where the real upside for Microsoft stock lies, the Cortana integration. The Growing Field of AirPods CompetitorsWhen Apple introduced the AirPods alongside the iPhone X in 2017, the bizarre-looking wireless earbuds were widely mocked. It didn't take long before traditional earbud manufacturers realized their mistake, though. AirPods were a surprise success and demand went through the roof.AirPods currently hold 60% of the global market for true wireless earbuds, and in March the company released its second generation version with hands-free Siri.And it's Siri that has caught the attention of the big tech competitors like MSFT. These companies realize that Apple is following the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook, sneaking Siri into a popular product category the way AMZN added Alexa to a wireless speaker with the Echo. They've seen how that's played out, with the explosion in smart speaker popularity driving up Alexa's popularity -- despite the fact that Amazon has no horse in the smartphone race.Since the AirPods were first announced, we've seen Pixel Buds (with Google Assistant onboard) from Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Galaxy Buds from Samsung with Samsung's Bixby voice assistant baked in. Amazon is reportedly working on Alexa wireless earbuds, in a move that could extend its reach to the smartphone. Microsoft releasing Surface Buds would follow that same pattern and the move would offer the same prize that Amazon is shooting for. With Microsoft's own smartphone ambitions shattered -- on both the hardware and Windows front -- selling consumers a set of Surface Buds is a way to get Cortana into use on smartphones.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Getting Cortana into more widespread adoption has huge advantages for MSFT. With machine learning, the more a voice assistant is used, the smarter it gets. The more popular it is, the higher the likelihood third-party electronics manufacturers will offer support in their products, such as smart home devices. Cortana uses Microsoft's Bing search engine by default, and that opens the door for ad and search placement revenue potential (paid Bing search netted MSFT $1.8 billion in 2017) when Surface Bud owners start asking for things like nearby restaurants or movie recommendations.   Surface Buds may sound like a niche product, but they're MSFT's play to regain a mobile foothold -- with billions of smartphones potentially in play. If the company can convince consumers that Surface Buds are superior to AirPods or Pixel Buds, Cortana adoption has a chance to grow. Added to the revenue hardware from selling the earbuds, that would be good news for Microsoft stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2638,5041,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-why-investors-become-104911024.html?.tsrc=rss,4 Reasons Why Investors Have Become Too Optimistic About Disney Stock,2019-04-16,"Investors have bid up Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares since the company officially unveiled its new internet video offerings on Thursday. DIS stock spiked that day and have gained more than 12% as the market mulls the promise of Disney+ streaming.But even under the most optimistic scenarios, the company's internet video products won't be profitable anytime soon. Disney's streaming offerings will, in all likelihood, never generate nearly as much revenue as the company's current media networks, and DIS will likely face a choice of either losing a great deal of money on them or gaining very few subscribers. So until the streaming sector consolidates, Disney+ will probably only put pressure on its bottom line, tamping gains in Disney stock.With that forecast in mind, here are four reasons why the recent streaming-related DIS stock gains are overdone:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Even a Big Bull Doubts Profit Anytime SoonJPMorgan analyst Alexia Quadrani believes that Disney's new entertainment internet video offering, Disney+, will &quot;ultimately&quot; have &quot;as many as 160 million subscribers worldwide,&quot;versus Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) total, as of the end of last year, of 139 million subscribers, Barron's reported early last March.Given that Quadrani -- bullish on DIS stock for most of the past seven years -- says that Disney+ could have many more subscribers than NFLX, which has a first-mover advantage and has become extremely popular, I'd say she's very upbeat on the service's prospects.And yet, Quadrani, who says she has &quot;confidence in the resilient success of Disney+,&quot; predicts that the service will lose money until 2022, when, she expects it will break even.If she thinks that Disney's most wide-ranging internet video offering, which will include its most recognizable brands, won't break even until 2022, it's safe to assume that she expects its other two internet video offerings, ESPN+ and Hulu, to lose money for an even longer time. In all likelihood, if investors see that the new offerings will be unprofitable for some time, they will become less enthused about Disney stock.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Other analysts have put dollar figures on the amount that they expect DIS to lose on the streaming services in the medium term. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson expects the services to lose $3.9 billion this year and $4.9 billion in 2020,, and Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger says the losses will be higher than that, assuming that the company tries to sell its streaming services overseas.I don't think that the Street will be as upbeat on DIS stock when Disney starts actually reporting those losses. DIS Internet Video Won't Ever Generate as Much Cash as Old TVData indicates that Quadrani's subscriber estimates could be overly optimistic.In 2017, a poll quoted 36% of 18-to-29 year-olds as saying &quot;they were likely&quot; to subscribe to a Disney entertainment streaming service.But since then, competition in the sector has increased and is expected to continue to do so. (See below). With the stepped-up competition, millenial consumers have become frustrated with the large number of choices they have. That frustration will only increase as even more companies, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and AT&T's (NYSE:T) Time-Warner, enter the fray.For the sake of argument, let's say that 25% of millennials wind up actually subscribing to Disney+. Given the high appeal of Disney's sci-fi and animation-heavy content and streaming to that age group, a higher percentage of them than Americans overall are likely to subscribe to the service. (I can't see many Baby Boomers or even &quot;empty nesters&quot; in their late 40s or 50s subscribing to Disney+).Assuming that 15% of American households subscribe to Disney+, at its current price of $70 per year, that equates to total annual revenue of $1.3 billion. Assuming that another 100 million overseas subscribe, at the same price, that equates to another $7 billion. If Hulu generates a third as much revenue for DIS as Disney+ in the U.S., and 25% as much overseas, it will bring in around another $2.7 billion.Let's say that ESPN+ also brings in 33% as much revenue as Disney+ in the U.S., and, given foreigners' preoccupation with their own local sports, only 10% as much revenue overseas. That would add another $1 billion to Disney's coffers. That comes to a grand total of around $12 billion per year for all three streaming solutions, and I don't think that level will be reached until 2022 at the earliest.In 2018, Disney's media networks generated $24.5 billion of revenue. So internet video in 2022 would generate about half as much revenue for DIS as Media Networks did in 2018, under fairly optimistic scenarios. So if 50% of Disney's old media revenue goes by the wayside in three years as cable and broadcast TV become less and less prevalent, the company's top line will remain unchanged.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Some will argue that DIS will be able to raise its subscription prices meaningfully by then. Given the steep competition it faces, I doubt that will be the case. But let's say it raises its prices by 30%, and the revenue from its old Media Networks still declines by 50% in three years. Under that scenario, its media top line will have risen by a grand total of 15% over five years. Should a 15% increase over five years really make investors excited about DIS stock, especially when Disney's streaming services at that point, under the best-case scenario, will barely be profitable? Horrible ChoiceAccording to techradar, &quot;Disney+ plans to have four to five exclusive TV shows and four to five original movies ready for the late 2019 launch.&quot; By contrast, Netflix plans to have dozens of new shows and movies coming out in just April and May of this year.When it comes to content on Disney+ and Hulu, it appears that DIS will have a horrible choice: spend almost as much on new content as Netflix and have its online video service lose billions of dollars every year like NFLX does, but have tens of millions of subscribers like Netflix, or have mostly old films and reruns of old shows and become a niche content provider for around 15 million parents of small children and sci-fi and animation enthusiasts. Put another way, it's hard to imagine many more than 20 million households around the world shelling out money for a streaming channel that consists primarily of TV reruns, old movies, and current Disney Channel and ABC fare. So DIS and the owners of DIS stock face an unappetizing choice: very high content costs or relatively low revenue. Either way, Disney+ won;t be profitable. Competition Is Fierce And Getting FiercerI've written about the tremendous competition in the internet-video market many times. In addition to Netflix and Amazon, Dish (NASDAQ: DISH) ,Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and Plex have offerings in the sector, Two more big kahunas -- Apple and Time Warner -- will enter the race soon. And Hulu and Disney+ could even wind up stealing each other's users.I doubt whether most households will want to pay for more than two or three of these services. Given Netflix's first-mover advantage and the plethora of strong competitors, that means the other services probably have a ceiling of 40 million U.S. households. That, in turn, is more bad news for the outlook of Disney stock.As of this writing, the author did not own the stocks of any companies mentioned in this article.

The catalyst has been a series of ROKU stock downgrades by the likes of Guggenheim, Macquarie and Citigroup (NYSE:C) analysts.News from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about its plans to refocus on the services business, including TV streaming, while light on details, still made investors question the impact on ROKU. While the Los Gatos, California device maker may well have been the pioneer in TV streaming with its ROKU players and ROKU TVs, other entrants with substantial resources are entering the space in a big way.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Despite the past month's retreat, ROKU stock's YTD performance has been literally out of this world. It has blown past FAANG stocks and the major indexes by a huge margin. Before the wobbles in early March, ROKU stock was up well over 100% when investors (on the long side) were just happy to see the S&P 500 index bounce back 13%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pressure on ROKU Stock Meanwhile Roku hasn't been able to catch a break after Apple's announcement. It reported a strong fourth quarter with active accounts growing 40% over the prior year and streaming hours were up 69%.That was the past. Now, sell-side analysts have been citing excessive valuation, increased insider selling, and the company filing to sell stock, in a series of rating downgrades. In addition, competition is heating up. Beyond Apple TV, the Android TV operating system and Fire TV platform are real threats to ROKU. Android TV operator partners have increased to 140 from eight in 2016 .As Citi Research indicated in its note to clients,&quot;With large numbers of pay TV providers and smart TVs directly integrating apps into their platforms, consumers may find fewer reasons to purchase OTT devices or use services like Roku.&quot;The fact is that the TV streaming space has changed in a big way since ROKU's 2017 IPO. ROKU's main source of revenue is advertising and their ability to data on consumer viewing habits is what helps them generate better value propositions for its advertisers. Their advertising platform is where the growth is, but new entrants will hurt this engine when advertisers start spreading their dollars to other platforms. Bottom Line on ROKU StockThe main problem is that there is no moat around ROKU's business, i.e., the barriers to entry are low for other players in the tech space. It's not difficult by any means to change a Roku dongle to an Apple dongle. While it may have a strong content offering at the moment, having recently announced a deal with HBO, that won't be enough for Roku to hold onto subscribers in the face of an onslaught of competition.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Investor recognition that the future seems tenuous could account for the 3.8% decline in the ROKU stock price over the last five trading sessions. It may try to shrug off Apple as a non-threat, showing its double-digit growth figures from past quarters, but the threat it faces is real and its position as a one-stop-shop for free and premium entertainment is going to change. ROKU's platform is going to decrease in relevancy.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2678,5222,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-trade-ins-help-boost-221232674.html?.tsrc=rss,Can iPhone Trade-Ins Help Boost Apple (AAPL) Stock?,2019-04-10,"With iPhone sales slowing, Apple (AAPL) â once the worldâs highest valued company by a wide margin â has come back to earth. It isnât necessarily that customers donât want new iPhones â most do â but that the upgrade cycle has become longer, meaning a customer may buy a new phone after two-and-a-half years instead of two. One way Apple is trying to shorten the cycle is by offering a generous buy-back program, where a customer trades in their old phone for a new one, at a lower price. Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan believes this could help shorten the cycle, as he maintains a Buy rating on Apple stock, while lifting the price target to $220 (from $210), which implies nearly 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Mohan's track record, click here)There was a time where a new iPhone every two years was pretty normal, especially with carriers locking customers in to two-year contracts. But Mohan says, âmultiple factors have increased the time between iPhone upgrades over the past several years, including lack of carrier subsidies, introduction of higher priced iPhones, and phones without step function changes in features/functionality.â The analyst believes âconsumers are not realizing the residual value of the iPhones they own (highest residual value across brands),â and that Apple âwill drive an initiative to increase trade-ins,â which will push customers to upgrade. Based on the analystâs survey of about 18k people in China, India, Great Britain and the U.S., models range from the âlatest models (XS, XS Max and XR) to models older than iPhone 4.â The most popular models are the 6, 6S and 7, which the analyst says is âexactly the models that Apple is targeting for trade-ins.â Playing off this, the analyst estimates â24% or 216mn units of the 900mn iPhone installed base are older than the iPhone 6. And 50% of those are candidates for upgrade,â which assumes about 100 million units. He also estimates 80% of âthe remaining 684mn newer iPhones (iPhone 6s and later)â are also ripe for upgrade, which would provide an additional ~500 million customers. So while many have been concerned over slowly sales, perhaps Apple is gearing up for a major headwind coming from customers ready to upgrade. All in all, Apple had a rocky 2018 but is quickly showing signs of old this year, with shares up nearly 30%. TipRanks analysis of 35 analysts shows a consensus Moderate Buy rating, with 18 analysts recommending Buy, 16 on the sidelines and one selling. However, the 12-month average price target of $194.90 reflects a 3% downside from its current price.

I can't say one way or another. What I do know for sure is that the markets prefer reasonable predictability. Right now, we're experiencing anything but that. To better protect your portfolio, consider these 15 safe dividend stocks to buy: American Express (AXP)Dividend Yield: 1.4%Credit-card company American Express (NYSE:AXP), offering a yield of 1.4%, isn't the most generous of dividend stocks. However, in my opinion, it's one of the safest places to earn passive income.Let's get the low-hanging fruit out of the way. First, American Express is a well-known and established credit provider and financial institution. This is a business that will likely not fade into obscurity, irrespective of economic conditions. Moreover, AXP caters to an affluent client base relative to its competitors.Second, AXP has significant international expansion opportunities. While American Express enjoys acceptance in over 130 countries, that's significantly below MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) 210-plus countries. And MasterCard isn't the number one credit card â¦ Visa (NYSE:V) is.While seemingly a disadvantage, this allows AXP to steal market share. Based on its resurgent revenue stream, the company is on the right track. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Dividend Yield: 5%I must admit that I'm not the biggest fan of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). By their nature, insurance providers don't offer the most upside potential in the markets.That said, health insurance is, and will continue to be a massively lucratively market, if only for cynical reasons. In July, I mentioned that the average American lifestyle is shockingly unhealthy. Furthermore, we're simply not kicking our habit of eating processed foods and living sedentary lives.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Beyond that, UNH features consistently strong revenue growth, and barring unusual events, this year will be no different. On the yield front, UNH again isn't the most lavish among dividend stocks to buy. But the company's very predictable free cash flow and overall industry provide significant confidence for prospective investors. Disney (DIS)Dividend Yield: 1.57%It's not often that you celebrate professional failure. But for Disney (NYSE:DIS), Wall Street apparently sees the silver lining after the iconic entertainment firm lost a bidding war to long-time rival Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). At stake was British television company Sky (OTCMKTS:SKYAY).On the surface, you could understand the near-desperation with which the two media titans fought. Sky opens the door to the lucrative European TV market. Comcast, in particular, lost out to Disney over another protracted battle for Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA). Call it the male ego gone wild, but Comcast wasn't leaving this battlefield empty-handed.CMCSA shareholders, though, had a differing opinion. This is a huge, expensive bet that Comcast can turn itself around due to Sky. Subsequently, CMCSA dropped 6% on the announcement, while DIS stock gained slightly over 2%.The best part for DIS shareholders is that they know management has free reign to expand without an excessively onerous weight. Sky certainly offered benefits, but they also brought with them traditional-TV baggage. Boeing (BA)Dividend Yield: 2.1%Thanks to a recent hissy fit with an iconic motorcycle manufacturer, President Trump is steadily running out of high-profile supporters. But one company stands in the batter's box that is safe from Trump's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) outbursts: Boeing (NYSE:BA).Let's get the obvious out of the way: Boeing manufacturers the most important airplane in the world, Air Force One. While Trump shows no mercy when he's upset at something or someone, even he can't go toe-to-toe with BA. The optics of a President attacking Boeing just won't fly.More importantly, BA stock has proven relatively immune to the ongoing China tariffs. Despite the White House imposing broad-scale sanctions, the Chinese have been measured in their response. As a result, Boeing's management team forecasts continued growth in China despite obvious geopolitical challenges.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives They have a right to be confident. China has left open the door for large airplanes, signaling that they recognize BA quality. Thus, while Boeing's 2.1% yield isn't the most attractive for dividend stocks, it should prove incredibly safe. Apple (AAPL)Dividend Yield: 1.5%In terms of upside growth, I'm not a huge fan of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Don't get this wrong: I'm in awe of what the late Steve Jobs has done in turning a garage-based company into a global behemoth. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that AAPL is still a consumer-electronics investment, which has pros and cons.The obvious benefit to owning AAPL is that today, it's the undisputed king. Everybody clamors for the latest iPhone or whatever gadget Apple is selling next. The company has also become a cultural phenomenon.That said, the inherent risk is that Apple becomes mired in a commoditized market. For instance, peak smartphone has become an increasingly painful reality. You can't really distinguish among devices nowadays, which hurts AAPL unless management can spark excitement again.But if your primary focus is buying safe dividend stocks, AAPL offers an excellent look. The company features strong earnings and predictable FCF, and sits on nearly $86.5 billion of cash. United Technologies (UTX)Dividend Yield: 2.23%In my view, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) offers a safe, predictable route to both upside gains and passive income.In the markets, UTX would fall under many conservative analysts' bag of stocks to buy. Primarily, United Technologies owns the Pratt & Whitney division that powers our most advanced warcraft. This comes in handy with our dealings with North Korea. Despite admittedly positive developments, we're still negotiating with a despot.History tells me that North Korea will break any peace agreement. This is why I stand with former President Theodore Roosevelt: speak softly and carry a big stick.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives For those who love safe dividend stocks, UTX offers a great look. The company has excellent financials, which includes steadily rising revenues and strong earnings. Additionally, I like the predictability of United Technologies' cash flow. Walmart (WMT)Dividend Yield: 2.2%Only in recent years have analysts considered retail plays as stocks to buy. And even then, they apply significant caution into the names they pick. Thanks to the emergence of e-commerce -- and by e-commerce, I mean Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- brick-and-mortars have struggled for traction and relevancy.But Walmart (NYSE:WMT) should emerge not only unscathed but vastly improved. Management looked at Amazon's success and began shoring up their own e-commerce channels. Despite being a retail fixture for decades, WMT is proving technologically adept. As an example, management is turning to the blockchain to help contain food poisoning.WMT also levers the substantial advantage of having a physical presence. No matter how great online shopping is, nothing beats going out to the store and attaining instant satisfaction. Plus, WMT sells everything, with some stores open 24 hours.In other words, WMT is one of the safest dividend stocks to buy because Amazon can't topple its moat. Amgen (AMGN)Dividend Yield: 3%The pharmaceutical sector is always a tough business. Should a proposed drug fail to meet expectations during clinical trials, a lesser-financed outfit could quickly crumble. Add to this mix the political environment, and you have a combustible recipe.Still, I believe Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers a distinctive and positive approach to the sector. Unlike other pharma giants, AMGN focuses on a handful of therapies that work. Yes, nominally, they're very expensive. However, they're for extremely serious diseases and conditions, and are not taken frequently.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives As a result, AMGN stock is a decisive winner, having gained around 11% in the last year. Moreover, the company features enticing fundamental strengths. Amgen puts up consistently positive earnings, as well as predictable FCF. It also has over $29 billion in cash, providing confidence for its 3% dividend yield. Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP)Dividend Yield: 2.5%Soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has had a rough time  dealing with changing consumer habits. Americans, especially the younger demographic, eschew sugary beverages for healthier alternatives.Overall, I see Coca-Cola making the changes it needs to stay relevant in this ultra-competitive sector. However, I'm particularly intrigued with Coca-Cola European Partners (NYSE:CCEP). CCEP has shot up over 11% YTD. Coca-Cola's European bottler and distributor also pays out a fairly generous 2.5% dividend yield.While it has enjoyed a good year so far, CCEP has the goods to continue moving further down the road. While most people around the world are shifting towards healthy food and beverage options, the numbers speak the loudest. In western Europe, the market value of soft drinks have steadily risen over the past several years.That signals to me that CCEP benefits from a growing industry. Moreover, it has the fundamental stability to keep its attractive yield intact. Procter & Gamble (PG)Dividend Yield: 2.77%Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a decidedly unsexy investment. A consumer-staples play, nobody really clamors to add PG stock to their portfolio. It's just there in case you need a usually dependable stock to protect yourself.In 2019, PG has gained 13.5%. Part of the recovery is likely due to its 2.77% dividend yield, which should prove very sustainable.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives For one thing, PG has an undeniable hold on consumer staples. No matter what, people have to buy things like soap, detergents and cold medicines. Second, the company has steadily grown its top and bottom lines, and it features robust FCF. J.M. Smucker (SJM)Dividend Yield: 2.9%J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) earnings results have been mixed in recent years. However, one point to consider is its industry. As a popular food and beverage provider, the company's products will never go out of style. That provides a measure of reassurance, especially if the markets hit unforeseen headwinds.Furthermore, J.M. Smucker is one of the more generous safe dividend stocks to buy with a 2.9% yield. Thanks to relatively consistent earnings and positive FCF, investors can confidently rely on SJM. Harley-Davidson (HOG)Dividend Yield: 3.8%In 2018, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) experienced a double-whammy. As alluded to earlier, President Trump lashed out on HOG because management doesn't agree with his stance on tariffs. That opposition doesn't come as a surprise since HOG faces a demographic challenge. Not many young people desire Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which sounds almost sacrilegious.The other problem is that HOG has disappointed in the markets. On a 12-month basis, shares are down nearly 7%. With the ongoing China tariffs, Wall Street doesn't feel comfortable with the motorcycle manufacturer's growth prospects.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives But let's agive credit to management, which isn't taking consumer trends lying down. Instead, it's diving into relevant segments, such as committing to electric motorcycles. While it doesn't look great now, I think patient investors will be very happy with HOG in the future, and the 13% gain of HOG stock in 2019 shows that investors think it's on the right track. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Dividend Yield: 4%Usually, safe dividend stocks to buy offer limited passive income. That's basically how the free market works: if you want additional rewards, you must ramp up the risk. But for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), its 4% dividend yield is as good as gold.Actually, right now, it's better than gold for one simple reason: have you seen gas prices recently? You better believe that the current oil market has benefitted XOM stock. In 2019, shares are up almost 20%.Despite our greenbacks being generally stronger than other currencies, we're going to feel more pain at the pump. In addition to North Korea, Trump is taking on Iran. Through sanctions, he hopes to bring Iran to the negotiating table, with denuclearization an absolute must.The problem is that Iran exports two million barrels of crude oil daily. Undoubtedly, we can win a war of attrition with the Middle Eastern nation. However, it will cost us. Unless that is, you're a XOM shareholder. International Business Machines (IBM)Dividend Yield: 4.4%International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another one of those dividend stocks that have tried investors' patience. Although it has earned a powerful reputation in the tech sector, many people regard IBM as a legacy company. But that doesn't mean this old dog is forever doomed to be irrelevant.Remember that tidbit earlier about Walmart using the blockchain to help eliminate food-poisoning cases? Well, the provider of the blockchain platform is none other than IBM. I believe it's incredibly significant that Walmart could have gone with any number of options. Instead, it went with IBM, not some upstart competitor promising much but delivering little.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives Plus, IBM has the foundational strength to support its 4.4% dividend yield.  It has consistently positive earnings, as well as reliable FCF. Finally, IBM is sitting on over $12 billion of cash. AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 6.45%No one doubts that AT&T (NYSE:T) is a favorite among dividend stocks. The telecom giant currently offers nearly a 6.45% yield, which is better than some blue chips' equity-market returns.That said, analysts have debated whether or not T stock is worth its yield. Management has incurred significant debt to get to where it is. AT&T is exposed to disparate businesses, which has its own risks.But with the 5G rollout, I don't think you can afford to ignore T stock. Sure, rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) stole AT&T's thunder by becoming the world's first commercial 5G service provider. And I think VZ can do very well with their first-to-market advantage.However, AT&T is taking extra time to do things right, where they will roll out 5G using only standard equipment. Over the long run, the smart money favors T stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday.Dutch Investigation: Apple is facing an investigation from a Dutch antitrust watchdog, reports MacRumors. The watchdog group is looking to see if AAPL is giving its own apps in the App Store preferential treatment over those made by other developers. The tech company has already responded to the investigation announcement. It says that it is &quot;confident&quot; the investigation will find that it gives all developers the same treatment.iTunes Future: A recent report claims that iTunes will still be around after standalone apps launch for Mac, reports 9to5Mac. This report notes that even after the release of the rumored Books, Podcasts and Music apps, iTunes will still remain as its own app. However, the report claims that the tech company is likely to stop future development of the app in favor of focusing on the standalone ones.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLawsuit: Apple is facing a new lawsuit that claims it is infringing on a large amount of patents, reports AppleInsider. This lawsuit comes from Seven Networks and was filed in the Eastern District Court of Texas. The lawsuit claims that AAPL is infringing on 16 of its patents. This isn't the first time the tech company has had to deal with patent lawsuits in this area. It's likely one of the reasons that is is closing its physical stores in the district to avoid similar lawsuits.Check out more recent Apple Rumors or Subscribe to Apple Rumors : RSS As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2702,5296,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-stock-continue-outperform-010846317.html?.tsrc=rss,Will Apple (AAPL) Stock Continue to Outperform Despite Late Arrival of 5G iPhone?,2019-04-09,"Things continue to get murkier for Appleâs (AAPL) iPhone transition to 5G Modems, with more and more expectations shifting to a 2021 launch for an iPhone model with 5G capabilities. This will lag Samsung (SSNLF) by two-years, and it puts somewhat of a damper on expectations for iPhone upgrades, as it diminishes the perceived value in comparison to smartphone peers. It doesnât necessarily mean consumers wonât upgrade to new iPhoneâs, but it gives them less of a reason to do so.Appleâs stock has continued to rally despite declining expectations tied to the hardware business, and with more emphasis on software and services revenue.Given Appleâs growing installed base of users, and opportunities to continue monetizing that base of users with a plethora of new and pre-existing apps, services, and app store sales itâs not a matter of whether or not Apple can continue to monetize the pre-existing base, but whether they can continue to generate excitement in the foreseeable two-years absent of 5G capabilities. Appleâs business model does remain attractive, and itâs difficult to imagine consumer preferences changing just because Apple doesnât transition beyond LTE as quickly as other high-end variant phones.However, rather than the risk of smartphone market share loss, whatâs more probable is a loss of interest tied to smartphone upgrades in the upcoming cycles without a new killer-feature tied to next generation iPhoneâs. Furthermore, Apple may have exhausted a lot of in-house efforts to improve the iPhone from prior-generations with the launch of iPhone X and X S. The perceived value of these phones gets diminished by the increase in pricing, and the absence of the home button. Some would prefer to have the home button, and others would not. Itâs certainly a feature of the iPhone I donât want to let go of, which is why Iâm not in any hurry to upgrade my iPhone to any of the iPhone X variants. Some would call the new design change innovation, but others who are more stubborn may hold onto iPhone 6, 7 and 8 generations longer. The performance of prior-generation iPhoneâs remains serviceable in most instances even when tied to gaming and tend to have similar response times to loading apps, hence the need to upgrade has become more questionable.Source: UBSThe iPhone installed base has reached 900 million iPhoneâs, and the growth of that installed base has slowed to single-digit percentage points, so if we forecast the addition of new smartphone users tied to the Apple ecosystem, units shipments from new customers would probably add 50 million to 90 million in annual shipments based on the single-digit growth rates. For Apple to reach consensus estimates, it would need to sell $140B worth of iPhoneâs at an ASP of $700 or 200 million units this fiscal year. The bulk of sales happen in Q1â19 where Apple reports holiday results, the rest of the year tends to slow down based on consumer buying and spending habits. With sales comps weak in Q1â19, the rest of the year will likely exemplify the same weakness in comps, hence the introduction of some other feature not tied to a major design overhaul would be welcomed at this point. However, the prospects of creating some new technology in such a short window is also unlikely. 5G would be welcomed at this point, but the on-going complications with the Qualcomm (QCOM) lawsuit has made Apple dependent on Intel.However, this is the sticking point for Intel, which only has 1 customer for its modems, which is Apple. Itâs not a profitable segment for Intel, and the cost of developing new modems has gone up considerably, as they continue to lag the roadmaps of Qualcomm. Intel isnât likely to release a modem this year, or even next year according to UBS commentary from their Asia Technology supply chain, and the earliest window has now moved to 2021 where Apple might in fact develop its own 5G Modem in-house. The added cost of developing a modem in-house might not even be worth the cost outlay, as thereâs a lot of patents tied to 5G technologies that Qualcomm owns, outright. The other alternative that could be pursued is Appleâs acquisition of Intelâs entire wireless division just to gain access to the IP and commence more in-house R&D, where they have continued to hire more and engineers in wireless modem design. Again, Qualcomm spent $5.4 billion on just R&D tied to wireless technologies in FYâ18, and Apple tends to split its R&D into a number of categories not tied to wireless development. Even if Apple were to pursue an expensive venture like buying-out Intelâs modem capabilities and plowing more resources into R&D, itâs not the soundest strategy for them to pursue given the delayed timeline and added cost that would surface in its financial results.This all points to a heightened likelihood that Apple will pursue a settlement at some point with Qualcomm and source the 5G modems from them. The challenges tied to developing entirely new silicon or acquiring new technologies and then developing in-house isnât only just cost prohibitive, it could delay upgrades in next-generation iPhone units, and upgrades have become more than 60% of annualized iPhone revenue currently. Throwing financial resources at a problem, and delaying iPhone upgrades isnât a sound strategy, and if anything, if the next iPhone launch in Q1â20 turns out to be worse than the prior one, Apple might eventually cave to Qualcomm and opt for a simpler upgrade cadence that might bring a bigger chunk of its installed base for upgrades.Features will become important for the next iPhone launch, and some miss steps in pricing, and design might have put a damper on expected upgrades, but the absence of 5G could lead to fewer upgrades, and the loss of sales from upgrades isnât something Apple can actually afford given the slowing growth of its installed base. Therefore, Qualcomm will likely win from a strategic perspective, and when Apple eventually pivots to Qualcomm as a supplier for modems, Qualcommâs results could significantly surprise. Investors should keep a close eye on Qualcomm, as its 5G capabilities gives the company a lot of leverage, especially in the higher-end segment of the smartphone market.Disclosure: The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned in this article.

Pot stocks were hot, value stocks were not. The headlines changed from week to week, and even beat-and-raise earnings weren't always enough to propel a stock forward.All of this has meant a good deal of shuffling among the contestants over the first three months, and one stock getting out to an astounding lead by the end of March. Which one? Well, read on and find out.The Best Stocks contest entries are listed below in ascending order of gains as of the end of trading on March 29. Those gains include the dividends, where applicable. And if you want to keep up-to-date on the contest between these quarterly updates, feel free to follow along at our Best Stocks for 2019 leaderboard, which is regularly updated so you can see who's rising and who's falling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: A Close Race at the Front But now, without further ado, on to the contestants. Syrah Resources (SYAAF)Investor: Eric Fry  Year-to-Date Change Through Q1: -28%Syrah Resources Ltd. (OTCMKTS:SYAAF) is an all-or-nothing sort of stock pick for a contest like this. SYAAF is set up for long-term growth thanks to the ubiquity of graphite -- the main focus of this Australian company.Graphite is used in a whole lot of the batteries that are going to power our future, including those for electric vehicles. But the company is also a one-mine operation and that mine is in Mozambique, meaning that in the short term, it can have more than its share of volatility.And that volatility has hit hard to the downside so far in 2019, with disappointing earnings sending the stock tumbling.That doesn't have to define the whole year for SYAAF, but the company must show serious improvement to win back investors' trust. As Fry wrote, &quot;Previously, Syrah had forecast that it would produce positive cash flow from its operations by the back half of 2019. But words are cheap. The company must deliver on that forecast if it expects to retain the trust and interest of shareholders.&quot;Read more about SYAAF from Fry here. LyondellBasell (LYB)Source: Via LyondellBasellInvestor: Charles Sizemore  YTD Change: 2%LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) is a value stock, and this set of market circumstances just aren't being kind to value stocks. People are riding the continued strength on the back of growth stocks instead. But that doesn't mean LYB stock is a bad security to be invested in. It just means that it's poised for a shift in sentiment.Now, will that happen in time to help with this year's Best Stocks contest? As Sizemore points out, there are no guarantees. &quot;While I believe that value stocks are 'due' for an extended period of outperformance, I could have made the same argument at any time over the past several years, and I'd still be waiting for the reversal,&quot; he wrote.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever But even if it just keeps up modest growth, there's still LYB stock's 4.4% dividend yield to keep in the back of your mind -- or put in your back pocket. And if sentiment turns back to value stocks, LYB could be in for a massive surge.Read more about LYB from Sizemore here. Weibo (WB)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Kyle WoodleyYTD Change: 6%The thesis behind picking Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) for the 2019 Best Stocks contest was simple -- good Chinese stocks took a beating in 2018 thanks to the U.S.-China trade war, and that made companies like Weibo excellent rebound candidates. As Woodley wrote, &quot;A quick refresher: Weibo shares hemorrhaged 43.5% in 2018 -- a year in which the company also grew revenues by 49% year-over-year and net income by 54% year-over-year.&quot;It's a sound thesis, but one that hasn't yet borne fruit in the first quarter. Part of that has to do with the still-fraught relationship between China and the U.S. And both Weibo and Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), which owns about 46% of WB stock, posted earnings beats in March, but both of the stocks fell hard after earnings, with Weibo off over 10% at one point that day.Why? As Woodley pointed out, &quot;If you're going to pick Weibo apart on anything -- and investors certainly did, considering the sharp selloff after its Q4 report -- it might be the company's revenue forecast. WB is looking for Q1 sales growth of 20.5% to 23.5%, which doesn't sound like much compared to Q1 2018's 76% jump in revenues.&quot;But â¦ that was really it. WB stock still looks strong, it just needs a nudge to start growing again.Read more about WB from Woodley here. Canada Goose (GOOS)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Will Ashworth  YTD Change: 10%Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) was flying pretty high at one point in this quarter, before a downgrade from Wells Fargo shot it down.&quot;The company itself continues to do well heading into 2019's second quarter. GOOS stock was doing fine through the end of February, trading above $57, putting my pick solidly in third place in InvestorPlace's 2019 stock picking contest,&quot; Ashworth wrote. &quot;But oh, what a difference a month can make.&quot;  * 10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio But things haven't completely soured for Canada Goose. It's still a sought-after brand name and its most recent earnings were a double beat and raise. GOOS stock still has plenty to offer investors in 2019.Read more about GOOS from Ashworth here. Teladoc (TDOC)Source:  MayApps207 via WikiMedia Investor: Jason Moser  YTD Change: 12%Virtual healthcare company Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) really charged into 2019.The TDOC stock price stumbled a bit after earnings in February. It wasn't the hard numbers that were a problem for investors -- they just weren't too keen on the guidance, which was below analyst expectations.But things are still looking up for Teladoc, as the trend is going its way. As Moser points out:&quot;Virtual healthcare and telemedicine are happening; it's no longer a matter of if but when, and Teladoc has done a lot to grow and diversify the business in a relatively short amount of time. One could also say that this business played an integral role in actually helping shape the legislation that is allowing virtual healthcare to become a part of the global healthcare landscape.&quot;And with Medicare Advantage 2020 set to add tens of millions of new potential clients to its rolls, there's still plenty of room for TDOC stock to run even higher.Read more about TDOC from Moser here. Adobe (ADBE)Source: Shutterstock Investors: John Jagerson and Wade Hansen  YTD Change: 18%Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been hanging around in the top half of the Best Stocks contest so far this year, but that has translated to more-than-acceptable gains of 18% for the quarter.Adobe has made the sort of tech shift that companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also been making -- the shift to a subscription model instead of a plain sales model for some of its most popular software.As Jagerson and Hansen put it, &quot;One of the important benefits of ADBE's shift into services, subscription and cloud products over the last few years has been an improvement in margins. This is particularly critical right now as investors prepare for poor first-quarter earnings reports from the components of the S&P 500.&quot;  * 7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks for Industry Expansion All in all, the Best Stocks for 2019 contest is far from over for ADBE stock.Read more about Adobe from Jagerson and Hansen here. Amazon (AMZN)Source: C_osett via FlickrInvestor: Readers' Choice  YTD Change: 19%Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to have a strong showing, and no wonder. While plenty of people, up to and including President Donald Trump, have taken aim at Amazon, it seems to shrug off every salvo with a deftness that most other massive companies envy. And while they waste their time on those antics, Amazon just keeps on trying new things, bolstering the things that work, and generally being the elephant in any number of rooms.But for Amazon to really challenge for the lead in the Best Stocks contest, it will probably need for one of its new or burgeoning business ideas to really take off. If it could take off like AWS has, that would be a game-changer, but that sort of massive success is extremely hard to come by.Still, Amazon has a lot going for it and keeps trying new things, which means that a success big enough to move the needle is certainly possible.Read more about AMZN here. Viper Energy Partners (VNOM)Source: SMelindo via Flickr (Modified)Investor: Neil George  YTD Change: 32%Oil prices have been undergoing a steady rise through most of the year so far (and even more so since the market bottom on Dec. 24, 2018), and Viper Energy Partners (NASDAQ:VNOM)  has benefited significantly from that growth.Whether or not oil prices continue their growth will control how well VNOM continues to perform to some extent, but it's not the only factor. The company is in a different position than many of its oil sector peers. As George wrote, &quot;Viper Energy is the leading landlord of the petroleum patch primarily in the Permian Basin which is at the center of the shale oil development in the U.S. market. As a landlord, the company doesn't drill or operate a single well -- but instead, leases out its land for exploration and development companies (E&P) for fee income and royalties on the oil and gas that gets pumped out of its land.&quot;  * 5 Cybersecurity Stocks to Watch As the Trend Heats Up So VNOM stock is set up to profit even if OPEC increases their oil flow. That means the company is probably going to be in the running for the Best Stocks title all year.Read more about VNOM from George here. Lululemon (LULU)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Louis Navellier  YTD Change: 35%Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the athleisure trend, but that is only the tip of the iceberg when looking at why it has surged so strongly through the first quarter.A feature LULU shares with tech titan Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is how both companies are able to charge premium prices for their goods, a move which can only help with the financials. And the financials for Lululemon are great. Looking at the earnings reports can lead you to another of the spectacular reasons LULU is surging.As Navellier puts it, &quot;Lululemon's same-store sales for the past fiscal year were up a staggering 16%. Usually, high single-digit growth is impressive.&quot;A membership program. Brand loyalty. Pricing power. Any investor looking for reasons to get into Lululemon can find a full plate of them, and LULU stock seems poised to keep flexing through the rest of the Best Stocks contest.Read more about LULU from Navellier here. Charlotte's Web Holdings (CWBHF)Source: Shutterstock Investor: Matt McCall  YTD Change: 81%CBD stock Charlotte's Web Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) took the top spot in the first quarter of our 2019 Best Stocks contest.There are plenty of reasons for this. Marijuana companies have been hot lately, for a start. Charlotte's Web has a great story and a leadership position in the CBD sector. According to McCall, &quot;It produces and distributes CBD wellness products to nearly 3,700 retail locations. It sells everything from tinctures to topicals to capsules, both online and in stores. It also has a line of pet-focused products, which is a niche area that is booming right now.&quot;And with the Farm Bill making changes to the federal legality of hemp, that sector could be expanding.And earnings recently put a bow on this pretty package. As McCall wrote, &quot;Fourth-quarter 2018 results were released after the close on March 28 and marked the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the company. The top line came in at $21.5 million, up 71% from one year earlier and 21% from the third quarter. Both figures are extremely impressive.&quot;  * 5 Low-Priced Tech Stocks With Great Potential It looks like more good things could be ahead for CWBHF, and if the trend continues, it could take the 2019 Best Stocks title going away.Read more about CWBHF from McCall here.Jessica Loder is an assistant editor for InvestorPlace.com.

And we're already beginning to see details emerge about the 2020 iPhones â¦ Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be focused on services like Apple TV+ at the moment, but the reality is that AAPL revenue and Apple stock remain tied to the iPhone.Source: Apple And a series of leaks from the supply chain suggest the company is pulling out all the stops in an effort to reverse the current slide in iPhone sales, including big moves in 2019 and next year. Triple Camera Coming to This Year's Big iPhoneApple helped to popularize the multi-camera setup that has become a standard in current smartphones -- with the exception of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pixels series. But the two-camera system AAPL introduced with the iPhone 7 Plus is now falling behind the competition. Samsung's new Galaxy S10 features a triple camera and Huawei's P30 Pro has four cameras.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best ETFs for 2019: A Close Race at the Front Apple is reportedly working on a triple camera system for the 2019 version of the iPhone Max. That is expected to deliver 3X optical zoom, and could also offer enhanced 3D sensing for augmented reality applications and better low light performance. 2019 iPhones Also Expected to Feature Two-Way Wireless ChargingApple killed the AirPower wireless charging mat that was announced at the 2018 iPhone launch. However, the company still has wireless charging ambitions.The 2019 iPhones will reportedly feature two-way wireless charging. This means the iPhone itself could charge AAPL's latest AirPods wireless earbuds simply by setting the AirPods case on the iPhone's back. To make two-way wireless charging more practical, Apple is expected to also boost the battery capacity for the 2019 iPhones.  Sounds good, but this feature was also a part of the latest Galaxy S10. Report: Three Sizes of iPhones Next Year, All OLEDThe latest big iPhone rumor skips 2019 to focus on the 2020 iPhones. According to a report this morning in Taiwan's Digitimes (via 9to5 Mac) Apple is planning to move to all-OLED iPhones next year. That has previously been reported by The Wall Street Journal.However, Digitimes has a new wrinkle that suggests the company could be up-sizing. Rumblings from Apple's supply chain point to 5.42-inch, 6.06-inch and 6.67-inch panels. That would give the 2020 Max model the largest-ever display in an iPhone, and assuming the middle size is the iPhone XR successor, it would mean the iPhone XS equivalent shrinks from the current 5.8-inch display. A smaller iPhone would help with customers who don't want a smartphone so large it requires two hands to operate -- a segment AAPL largely abandoned when it discontinued the iPhone SE.  Going all-in on OLED would give Apple premium quality displays across its entire lineup, and help to reduce the bezels on the iPhone XR. But those OLED displays are the single most expensive component in an iPhone, and that's going to put price (or profit margin) pressures on Apple. Is Playing Catch Up Good Enough?Apple helped to kick off the smartphone era with the iPhone in 2007. A decade of record-setting iPhone launches drove Apple stock to stratospheric levels while setting the design trends that other smartphone manufacturers followed. Now AAPL finds itself in the position of playing catch up.  * 7 China ETFs to Consider Right Now The 2019 iPhones may be the best yet, but Apple isn't expected to offer capabilities the competition will be heavily promoting, including 5G support and the option of a folding smartphone. Key upgrades this year -- including a triple camera system and pass-through wireless charging -- will be seen as trying to keep pace with the competition. That will make it tougher for AAPL to continue its strategy of boosting iPhone prices to keep revenue growing when unit sales are slipping. The question is, will Apple's moves in 2019 and 2020 be enough to stabilize and even grow iPhone revenue over the next few years while the company continues to expand its services? If so, that's good news for AAPL investors. If not, the continued reliance on iPhone revenue could spell bad news for Apple stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The communications giant will launch its long-awaited 5G network on Apr. 11, setting up another battle between VZ  and its longtime-rival, AT&T (NYSE:T).Source: Shutterstock Many will prefer VZ stock due to its first-mover status. Others will likely favor AT&T due to factors such as its more diversified holdings and its 5G network that will probably become the industry standard. However, because VZ will be one of the three companies to own a nationwide 5G network, VZ stock should move higher once consumers widely adopt the new standard.  * 15 Stocks to Buy Leading the Financial Charge  Verizon Will Lead the Way on 5GThe Apr. 11 launch will bring 5G only to select areas of Chicago and Minneapolis. Nonetheless, that will make VZ the first company to bring 5G wireless service to the market. It also places pressure on peers AT&T and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to play catch-up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut first-mover advantage is not the only key difference between VZ and its longtime peer, AT&T. As with 3G and 4G, Verizon will use a version of connectivity that will differ from its peers.In past years, VZ utilized CDMA wireless networks while AT&T and T-Mobile used the more common GSM standard. That difference will continue in the 5G realm.VZ stock has delivered positive, long-term returns despite the fact that it uses a different type of network. Likewise, using a different type of 5G network will likely not hurt Verizon stock. VZ Stock Has Become an &quot;All-In&quot; BetVerizon has adopted more of an &quot;all-in&quot; strategy than its peers on 5G.  Although it owns what once encompassed AOL and Yahoo, it has pursued a smaller content-media strategy than AT&T, which recently completed its $85 billion Time Warner acquisition.The strategy of VZ stock itself is also different. Both VZ stock and AT&T stock have low price-earnings ratios. Both also pay generous dividends, which have increased every year for decades.However, the stocks' PE ratios and dividend yields indicate that investors have more confidence in Verizon stock. Due to concerns about AT&T, its forward PE ratio has fallen to 8.8, while its dividend yield now stands at 6.5%.  The valuation of VZ stock also appears  reasonable. Still, with its relative stability, its forward PE comes in at a higher 12.3 with a dividend yield of 4.1%.TMUS stock pays no dividend, and its forward PE stands at 14.9. For this reason, I give both T and VZ stock the edge over T-Mobile. Also, for risk-tolerant investors, I agree with Barron's that AT&T, with its lower valuation and higher dividend yield, is superior . However, for those who are more risk-averse, I see many reasons to take a closer look at VZ stock. VZ Will Become &quot;Systemically Important&quot;Verizon's future depends almost exclusively on the success of 5G. For this reason, many will think that calling its &quot;all-in&quot; strategy less risky appears to be illogical.However, the importance of 5G will keep the three companies that own 5G networks--AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile--critical components of the overall economy. In essence, they have become &quot;systemically important&quot; in the same way that the stability of the largest banks has become vital to the health of the American economy. Due to our dependence on wireless communications, much of the economy would cease to function if the carriers' networks failed. This makes VZ stock one of the few  &quot;all-in&quot; bets that are safe.Ironically, AT&T's &quot;diversification&quot; into content could make that stock less safe. With its move into content, AT&T has become a competitor of industry giants such as Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).AT&T will struggle to match the heavy content spending of those companies. I doubt a failure of AT&T's content strategy would destroy it since it could sell its content assets. Still, since AT&T spent tens of billions to develop a 5G network,  it is unable to match the content spending of its peers. That makes the likelihood of AT&T's success in this area far from certain and could push more investors looking for a play on 5G into VZ stock. The Bottom Line on VZ StockVZ stock will likely benefit from its increased systemic importance. Verizon will lead the way as it launches some localized 5G networks later this month. However, as all three major wireless companies take networks online, many believe AT&T's diversification and its own 5G networks will give T stock the advantage over Verizon stock.Investors who can tolerate risk will more likely choose AT&T with its lower PE ratio and higher-yielding dividend. However, as 5G becomes an essential component of the economy, Verizon's strategy to bet primarily on wireless could make VZ stock less risky than its more content-dependent peer, AT&T.Moreover, VZ's valuation and dividend advantages probably give it the edge over T-Mobile. As a result, those who want less risk and a growing stream of 5G-related income are more likely to choose Verizon stock than its peers.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

That's the push behind its Apple TV+ video streaming service announced this week. AAPL stock popped 2.5% on the news before falling back.Yet, while the iPhone is no longer the big contributor it once was, one of the company's oldest sources of revenue -- and the star of its Services division -- is on track for explosive growth. A new report on the App Store says that thanks to consumer spending on mobile apps, it's on track to more than double sales in the next five years, hitting $96 billion by 2023.With Apple stock feeling the effects of sliding iPhone revenue, having an existing and proven source of service revenue that's projected to see big growth is good news for AAPL stock investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips $96 Billion App Store By 2023The App Store has become a jewel in the Apple's crown. The billion or so iOS devices out there download apps, many of which either cost a small fee upfront or have in-app purchase options, including subscriptions. The money spent by consumers on these apps is astounding. In 2018, Apple started the year with a press release touting the $300 million spent on apps on New Year's Day alone.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business And AAPL collects 30% of that spending.Source: Sensor Tower According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, total spending at the App Store hit $47 billion in 2018. That's impressive but in a report just released by the firm, Sensor Tower says growth in consumer spending on mobile apps is on pace to more than double over the next five years.&quot;Our projections call for global revenue on Apple's platform to reach $96 billion in the next five years, an increase of 104 percent over 2018's total of $47 billion at a CAGR of 15.6%. Google Play, by comparison, is projected to reach $60 billion in worldwide spending, up 140 percent over 2018 at a CAGR of 19%.&quot;In comparison, AAPL's entire Services division revenue for 2018 -- including the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, Apple Music, AppleCare and other sources -- was $37.2 billion. The Sensor Tower numbers are good news for Apple stock, suggesting that App Store revenue will grow at a rate that will help that Services division make up for declining iPhone revenue. Google Play Growing Faster, But 2Projected App Store revenue growth is the big takeaway from the Sensor Tower report, but it also predicts Apple will continue to lead Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) when it comes to monetizing apps. Alphabet's expected to see a higher growth rate in Google Play app revenue, but won't come anywhere near catching Apple's App Store in total consumer spending. We focused a few months back on why the App Store dominates Google Play -- despite the massive numbers advantage of Android over iOS. There Are Still Risks for AAPL Stock Overall, the Sensor Tower report is good news for for Apple stock. Yet, there is one trend that is somewhat worrying. The big growth rates in app store spending over the next five years is expected to be in emerging markets, while the largest overall spender on mobile apps will be China. These are Android strongholds, where Apple struggles to sell its premium-priced iPhones.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 In the long term, AAPL may have a challenge keeping developers focused on iOS if Android app spending ever hits the point where it begins to outpace the App Store.There's also the double-edged sword of subscription-based App Store revenue. It's great for AAPL's bottom line, but companies that offer subscriptions are beginning to balk at Apple taking 30% of their revenue (dropping to 15% after one year). The highest grossing app on the App Store in 2018 was Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but to avoid losing a cut to Apple, consumers can no longer pay for their Netflix subscription through the app.There have also been rumblings of anti-monopoly sentiment against Apple that could impact the way it operates the App Store. And Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) has complained to the EU regulator that the 30% fee is aimed at killing their business.But for now, AAPL stock investors can celebrate the fact that the App Store is on pace to notch impressive sales and revenue growth over the next five years.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Since bottoming out at the beginning of the year âÂ down nearly 40% since its October high â Apple stock is up to a four-month high. Though the company is still embroiled in a legal battle with Qualcomm and China still remain a question mark, shares are up more than 20% year-to-date, as excitement grows over new products and services. Just this week Apple announced an upgraded version of its AirPods, as well as upgrades to its iMac line and iPad Mini. Next week, the company is expected to be an even bigger week for the company, with expectations of announcements on subscriptions and services. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives remains bullish on AAPL, maintaining his Outperform rating, while increasing his price target to $215 (from $200), suggesting the stockÂ has 13% upside potential over the next 12 months.Â (To watch Ives' track record,Â click here)On Monday, Apple is expected to announce a new streaming service. Ives believes this new service will âcompete with the likes of Netflix, Disney, Hulu, among others,â and is âa pivotal step for Cupertino in further driving its services flywheel and entering the âstreaming content arms raceâ which is clearly starting to take form.â But Ives says the announcement âis just the tip of the iceberg for Cook's broader streaming content strategy to take hold and...adds a significant potential catalyst to the Apple services growth story for years to come.â Ives calls Appleâs growing services business a âwild card in driving the valuation higher for Apple.â The analyst estimates a $400 million valuation for the services segment, with revenue expected to pass $50 billion by FY20. The new streaming service is expected to be a major boost to the segment, as Ives says Apple âis spending roughly $1 billion on original content this year,â including working with Oprah and Steven Spielberg. Though Ives is bullish on the new service, he realizes the company is âdefinitely playing from behind the eight ball in this content arms race with Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Hulu, and AT&T/Time Warner...investing significantly more dollars ($20 billion combined and counting per annum) on content.â But given Appleâs massive cash holdings, Ives says Apple should look into âlarger, strategic M&A (a24, Lionsgate, Sony Pictures, CBS/Viacom, Netflix, MGM) around content over the coming yearâ¦â in order to even the playing field more quickly.Assuming all goes well for the new service, Ives believes âreaching 100 million subs in the medium term (3 to 5 years) is a realistic goal that could translate into a $7 billion to $10 billion annual revenue stream over time for Apple and further cement its installed base and halo effect.â With this, the analyst increases his price target by $15. While Apple was once a sure-fire stock, the tide has turned for the tech giant. But with shares up more than 30% since its January low, things are looking better for the company. TipRanks analysis of 37 analysts shows a consensus Moderate Buy rating, with 20 analysts recommending Buy and 17 on the sides. However, the 12-month average price target of $183.26 reflects a 6% downside from its current price.

However, it wasn't alone. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) also didn't join the rally, leaving many to wonder what was causing the hesitation. However, over the past few days, we've seen a big rally of Amazon stock, signaling that its slumber may be coming to an end.Is now the time to buy AMZN stock?  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course Investors first have to ask themselves if they like the company or if they like the stock. Bullish investors who are purely looking to trade Amazon stock are late. Those who were prepared came into this week long and are now raising their stop-losses and locking in some gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, if investors like the company, it doesn't hurt to wait until the stock's technicals are becoming more bullish. For investors in that camp, there are plenty of reasons to like Amazon stock. Amazon Stock Is a JuggernautThe best thing about AMZN stock may have been its recent cheapness. Until recently, the shares were almost 20% off their highs, and they stayed there for several months. That gave investors a chance to gobble up Amazon stock while it was on sale.But I understand that the valuation of AMZN, as it always has been, is insane. AMZN, however, is not a traditional company and therefore it is not bound by traditional valuation metrics. I know strict, traditional investors will have a field day with that &quot;exception to the rule&quot; explanation, but it's true. Some investors' unwillingness to acknowledge such exceptions has kept them from buying the market's biggest winners, like Amazon and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).You didn't have to hold these names for 20+ years or buy shares during their IPOs to reap massive gains. We knew what AMZN and NFLX were all about ten years ago and could have made a massive amount of money going long AMZN stock and NFLX stock. In the last decade, Amazon stock has surged &quot;just&quot; 2,420%, turning $10,000 into a quarter-million dollars, while Netflix has jumped almost 6,000% in the same time frame.Even over the last five years -- when each company's long-term, non-cyclical opportunities had already become clear -- AMZN stock and NFLX have returned about 375% and 500%, respectively. And given all of Amazon's opportunities, owning Amazon stock is worthwhile.Its e-commerce unit has considerable revenue and is already well-known, but its other units are garnering attention, too. Its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has become one of the most dominant in the industry. Given its huge popularity, its ad business has also become quite attractive. It likely obtains annual cash flow of $10 billion from Prime membership fees, and its Whole Foods acquisition gives Amazon a presence in the grocery sector. Trading AMZN Stock  Click to Enlarge From a trading perspective, the time to go long Amazon stock has come and gone. That opportunity presented itself last week before the stock's $80 move. It's now prudent to trim positions in Amazon stock and raise stop-losses.For longer-term investors, AMZN stock is looking much better, now that it has exceeded its 200-day-moving average. It will look even better if it can hold that mark after this fresh breakout.If it can stay above that level, AMZN can begin the process of pushing higher again. Once it climbs over that $1,775-ish level, which kept AMZN in check in November and December, AMZN stock can really start to fly. The next level of interest would come into play near $1,850.Remember, cloud names have been on fire, and Amazon has a significant cloud presence. For the past few quarters, management's outlook has kept bulls at bay. However, AMZN stock is known for gathering momentum after big declines. Amazon stock fell almost 35% from peak to trough in recent month and, historically, has gone on to post big gains after those types of stumbles.I have no reason to bet against AMZN over the long- term. I also have no reason to bet against it in the short-term if it stays above the 200-day.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

After Wednesday's Fed news, that's no surprise. Let's get a look at some of today's big movers with our must-see stock trades. Must-See Stock Trades 1: AppleEarlier this month we outlined the long trade in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Then earlier this week, we said investors should consider locking in some profits after the stock's monster move. Now AAPL is erupting more than 4% on Thursday as the longs keep on cashing in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees $200 becomes an obvious magnet, even as its RSI and MACD (green circles) continue into extended territory. This setup does not favor new long positions, but the recent strength does give us a solid buy-the-dips setup going forward.If you're still long, consider trailing up those stops and locking in some gains. Must-See Stock Trades 2: GuessGuess? (NYSE:GES) picked a pretty interesting time to report earnings, with the worse-than-expected results coming on the evening before Levi (NYSE:LEVI) went public.The latter is up more than 30% on the day as investors gobble up the new IPO. On the plus side, GES stock is clinging to range support near $19. This level has been vital over the past 12 months.There are better buys out there than GES, but investors who feel compelled to go long can use Thursday's low as their stop-loss. Must-See Stock Trades 3: VentasVentas (NYSE:VTR) isn't necessarily the top stock to focus on, but its price action gives us opportunity. On Wednesday we talked about how the Fed gave bulls the green light, saying it's essentially on hold this year when it comes to rate hikes. Well, that bodes incredibly well for dividend stocks and REITs.There's a reason why names like AT&T (NYSE:T), VTR, Realty Income (NYSE:O), Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) and others are surging on the day. Look to see if these names can give us some follow through on Friday and into next week. (Here's the setup on AT&T).For VTR specifically, it held uptrend support and is back over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. Look to see if it can get to and breakout over $65. Must-See Stock Trades 4: QorvoShares of Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) erupted more than 7% on Thursday thanks to an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. But an earnings beat from Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and continued strong price action from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) (trade layout here) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) (trade layout here) certainly helps.The move up through $74 is significant. Not only has this level played a notable role in the past, but it's the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range. Maintaining this level paves the way to $78. Should QRVO fail to hold this level, it would be encouraging to see it hold the 200-day as support.Bulls shouldn't let Qorvo get below the 20-day and uptrend support. There's still room to rally according to the MACD and RSI, despite Thursday's big move. Must-See Stock Trades 5: SquareTrending higher and peeking through resistance is Square (NYSE:SQ). The move puts SQ over the 20-day moving average and if it can close over $78, it opens up the possibility of a move to $82.50.This name tends to be volatile, but over the 200-day and SQ stock is fine. Admittedly that's a wide range from current levels but the RSI and MACD still leave plenty of room for the stock to rally. Must-See Stock Trades 6: Electronic ArtsLet's do one more really quick with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Up 7.5% on the day and it's breaking out of its recent range in a big way. I want to see EA stay over $100 now. My upside target is $108.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL, VTR, O, DLR and SQ.

Back in late 2018, amid a broader market sell-off and slowing iPhone sales, Apple stock dropped nearly 40% off all time highs in just three months.Source: Shutterstock Ever since, though, broader financial markets have stabilized and investors have realized that Apple doesn't need robust iPhone unit growth to be a healthy company. Apple stock has consequently rebounded strongly, rising 30% off its early January lows.Now, AAPL is rapidly closing in on its 200-day moving average, implying that things are back to normal for the stock. Does that mean the best of this turnaround rally is over? Or is there more runway left?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% A bit of both. The best in the turnaround rally does appear to be over. The present valuation implies you won't get another 30% rally in APPL over the next two months. But, this rally isn't over just yet.The fundamentals, powered by high-margin growth in Apple's Services business, imply that this stock has runway to $200 in 2019.As such, while the best of the Apple stock turnaround rally has already happened, this rally isn't over yet, either. The stock still has another 10%-plus upside left in 2019. Coupled with a 1.6% dividend yield, that makes the return profile on Apple stock look pretty good at $180. Don't Expect Another 30% RallyApple has come very far, very fast in 2019, and investors shouldn't expect this pace of gains to be replicated in the future.AAPL rallied 30% in two months. That is one of the largest and fastest rallies this stock has staged over the past decade. Importantly, the rally has been so big and happened so quickly, that further upside appears to be limited.Namely, Apple stock now trades at a 16 forward earnings multiple. Historically, this stock trades around 13.5-times forward earnings. Plus, the current yield on Apple is 1.6%, and that's below average (1.7%). Meanwhile, the backdrop remains sluggish global economic growth and muted smartphone unit growth.To be sure, the stock was able to rally against that backdrop in early 2019 because the forward multiple was below-average (12) and the yield was above-average (2%). But, that's no longer the case today. You have an above-average valuation and a below-average yield on a stock that's still struggling to cope with peak iPhone.It's also worth mentioning that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on Apple recently jumped into overbought territory.In other words, a relatively stretched valuation and overbought conditions prohibit Apple stock from rallying another 30% over the next two months, meaning that the best of the Apple turnaround has already come and gone. But, the entire rally isn't over, either. Upside to $200 Is DoableThe fundamentals underlying Apple stock are favorable and imply healthy near and long term upside in the stock.In a nutshell, Apple doesn't need robust iPhone unit growth to keep its business on an upward trajectory. Sure, the volume of people buying new iPhones every year isn't going up. But, very few people are switching out of the iPhone ecosystem, meaning that iPhone unit growth should remain stable while iPhone revenue growth should be positive thanks to price hikes.More important, a very large and stable iPhone install base gives Apple an enormous opportunity to monetize that install base through various software services, like Apple Music, App Store, and a soon-to-be-announced Apple streaming service.The sum of all those services will provide Apple with a large chunk of subscription-based, high-margin revenue flow, which will ultimately impact Apple's financials by boosting revenue growth, providing more revenue stability, pulling up margins, and supercharging profit growth.All four of those financial impacts are positive stock price drivers. As such, AAPL should continue to rally over the next several years thanks to super-charged Services growth.How much can Apple rally? Quite a bit. Revenue growth through 2025 should run around the low to mid single digit range. Margins should trend higher thanks to higher iPhone ASPs and bigger contributions from the Services segment. Buybacks will continue at a healthy pace. All together, profits should grow at a steady high single to low double digit rate for the foreseeable future.That would put fiscal 2025 EPS around $19. Based on a market average 16 forward multiple, that equates to a 2024 price target for Apple of over $300. Discounted back by 8.5% per year (below my 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a 2019 price target of just over $200. Bottom Line on Apple StockApple is a long term winner that will stay on a winning trajectory thanks to expansion of its Services business. But, the stock has come very far, very fast in 2019, and this pace of gains going forward is unsustainable. As such, investors should expect the stock to cool off some, but remain on an overall upward trajectory.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL.

And for the company's sake, it should.Apple ran into the brick wall of a slowing global smartphone market last year; smartphone shipments have logged five consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. The trend is clear, and Apple isn't immune. In fact, Apple has more to lose than many of its smartphone competitors because the iPhone is its primary revenue generator. It was a decade of record-breaking iPhone sales that pushed Apple to become a trillion-dollar company in 2018.Apple responded to slowing demand by increasing the price of its flagship iPhones, leveraging the higher average sale price to buoy revenue, even as iPhone unit sales fell. That helped to plaster over the problem for a while, but in January the company reported that quarterly iPhone revenues had declined a whopping 15% from the previous year.Clearly Apple must count on other products and services to take up the iPhone revenue slack. So look for 2019 to be a busy one for Apple CEO Tim Cook as his company cranks up the product releases.Here are 15 new products we expect Apple to announce at various events throughout 2019.

Reporters covering the trial reported that a jury agreed with Qualcomm that patents it used to demand royalty payments from Apple were valid. Jurors agreed with all infringment and damages claims by Qualcomm, which means Apple will have to pay the chip maker $31 million, according to reports from the courtroom. The trial is just one of many world-wide between the two companies, in which Apple is arguing that Qualcomm charges unfair royalty payments on its intellectual property. Another trial is scheduled to begin in San Diego next month, and the Federal Trade Commission is still weighing arguments made by the two sides in a trial that ended earlier this year. After news of the verdict hit, Qualcomm shares jumped to $57.34, 3.5% higher than Thursday&apos;s closing price, though gains settled down to about 1.7% soon thereafter.

3029,5993,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/long-overdue-pullback-roku-stock-091653342.html?.tsrc=rss,"The Long Overdue Pullback In Roku Stock Is Here, But It Wonât Stay For Long",2019-03-14,"A week ago, I put out a piece on InvestorPlace which broadly said that after a 160%-plus rally in under three months, shares of streaming company Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) were due for a pullback. The thesis: ROKU stock is a long-term winner, but stocks don't go up in straight lines forever, and Roku shares are nearing big technical resistance levels in the mid-$70's after coming very far, very fast.Fast forward a few days. We are getting that big pullback in Roku stock. Yesterday, shares dropped big on a pair of Wall Street downgrades which cited valuation and competition concerns. Naturally, following this big pullback, the question surrounding ROKU shares becomes: what now?  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio For starters, I wouldn't pay much attention to the analyst downgrades. Competition concerns don't hold water in the big picture. Valuation concerns are legitimate but they've been largely fixed by the recent 15% haircut investors gave to Roku stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, I would pay attention to two things: the big picture fundamentals and the technicals. Broadly speaking, the big picture fundamentals remain healthy, and support huge long-term upside in ROKU stock. Meanwhile, the technicals imply that the shares could bottom around $60. But, if they fall through the $60 floor, the next big level to watch for is $50.As such, I think now is a good time to start adding exposure to Roku stock again. Dip in your toes here. See if the $60 level holds. If it does, stick with the rally. If not, trim, and wait for $50. Long term, this stock is only going higher. Big Picture Fundamentals Remain HealthyBoth Loup Capital and Macquarie downgraded Roku stock on March 13, and that pair of downgrades sparked the big selloff. The tone of each analyst team was largely similar and went something like this: the stock has come very far, very fast, and is overvalued considering the plethora of competition risks on the horizon in the ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) space, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Although those downgrades have some merit, they lack credibility in the big picture.In that big picture, Roku is over-the-top (OTT) video access aggregation and curation. This has more and more value as the number of OTT video consumers and suppliers increases. Suppliers need Roku to reach an increasingly large and diverse consumer base; consumers need the platform to access an increasingly large and diverse supply of streaming services.In this sense, while some analysts think that new streaming services from Apple and Disney (NYSE:DIS) are a negative for Roku stock, they aren't. Sure, they create greater competition in the AVOD space. But, those services will also have to be streamed through Roku if Disney and Apple want to maximize reach. With a nearly 30 million -- and rapidly growing -- OTT video watcher base, Roku has unprecedented reach in this space. In fact, ahead of Apple's big streaming service launch, Apple and Roku have &quot;nearly finalized&quot; a deal to extend Airplay capability to Roku devices.Any dollars Roku loses in the AVOD space, it will win back in revenue sharing AVOD, TVOD (transaction video on demand), and SVOD (streaming video on demand) dollars. That is the inherent value of an aggregation and curator. Roku doesn't need to win every market. They just need to win the reach battle, become an irreplaceable centralized access point, and monetize through revenue sharing.That's exactly what Roku is doing. As such, the big picture fundamentals underlying Roku stock remain favorable. Pay Attention to the TechnicalsBecause the big picture fundamentals remain favorable, investors should pay attention to the technicals for clues as to when to buy the dip in Roku stock.Long story short, $60 could be a good entry point. During the big early 2019 rally, Roku stock blew way ahead of its moving averages. Now, it's retreating back to those levels, the closest of which is the 20-day moving average at $60. Roku stock appears to have held this technical level in the short term. If it can hold this level for the next several trading days, then it looks like the worst of this selloff is already over.That may not happen. ROKU stock may continue to fall, evening dropping below the 20-day level. If so, the next line of defense comes in at $50, which is where both the 50- and 200-day moving averages currently sit.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash The game-plan here is simple. Test the waters at $60. See if that level holds. If so, buy into the rally. If not, trim, and wait for support at $50. Bottom Line on ROKU StockRoku stock is a long-term winner supported by the thesis that the company is turning into a dominant OTT video service aggregator and curator. So long as those fundamentals remain healthy, ROKU stock will be a buy-the-dip stock at critical technical levels. We are closing in on one such key technical level at $60. As such, now seems like a good time to cautiously and slowly buy the dip in these sharesAs of this writing, Luke Lango was long ROKU.

The previous death cross had formed on Jan. 31, about a month after the stock had bottomed at a more-than 7-month low on Dec. 24. The previous golden cross on Aug. 9, 2016 appeared 32 sessions after a death cross, while the one before that appeared Oct. 8, 2015, which was just 7 sessions after a death cross.

We have had sustained selling and all efforts to buy the dip have so far failed. In that sense, it's reminiscent of what happened in December, which means companies reporting earnings this week are at a disadvantage during this headline sensitive time.Source: Shutterstock Last night, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reported its earnings and Costco stock is rallying 5% on the headline. This is despite the fact that markets are under tremendous pressure from China-based headlines.So for now, the bears are not looking to fight it.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo let's start with the fundamentals first. I am a fan of the company and I am a weekly customer. I think it's more than just a shopping trip but more of an experience. I often run into friends while there so it's almost like a trip to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).COST has a proven management team that always delivers on its plans. They almost never give Wall Street specific reasons to sell COST stock. Last night, management did it again, as they blew away the earnings-per-share expectations and that's the literal bottom line.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Moreover, they continue to grow total sales up 7%, which was a bit lower than expected but they made it up in other areas. While the overall comparable sales were impressive, their e-sales comps were up 25%. This is the trend to e-tailing that matters most to the retail sector investors. The impression is that online sales bring higher margins.Another saving grace for Costco stock is that management does not provide forward guidance. That is the one headline sellers love to sink their teeth into on earnings reports. The company could deliver the best report but if they show forward caution, the stock falls. Not for COST stock; management left no opportunity for sellers to act. The bears lack any reason to sell it on this headline.This is how it should be for every stock, because the forward guidance is merely an opinion or forecast and those can be wrong. It doesn't mean that the company is deteriorating. Nevertheless, Costco stock today is rallying and celebrating the news. How to Approach Costco Stock After EarningsAs much as I like the fundamentals, COST stock is not cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30. In absolute terms, I compare that to say Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and it's 40% more expensive. Or relatively speaking, it is twice as expensive as Target (NYSE:TGT). Only Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is more expensive among the retail stocks I track. TGT stock is not only cheaper, but it is also better. Year-to-date, TGT is up twice as much as COST.Nevertheless, the high P/E is not a deal breaker for me because if markets are rallying, then Costco stock is also with them. In other words, I'd own it for the long term. If that's the case, then I don't have to be surgical with my entry point and I should just buy it.But for the rest of us that like to enter a stock at optimal spots, there are lines to watch.The zone around $220 per share has been pivotal since last July. Usually, those levels of contention are resistance on the way up. But here, COST stock is beating them and if it closes above the zone, then the bulls could have solid footing to drive even higher into it.  * 10 Top Pot Stocks 2019 Has to Offer In this scenario, Costco stock would have a trend line breakout opportunity somewhere around $230 per share and it is a moving target. Since it set a new high last September, the stock has set a trend of lower highs. When bulls break through them, they tend to overshoot higher. This is easiest to see on the weekly chart.Shorter time frames show that the upside opportunity is at $232.50, but that level is also resistance. There is another potential stalling point at $29.80 from the failure on Dec. 12. For support, in case this spike fades for whatever reason, I'd look for the same pivot levels around $220 to continue to hold.In summary, these minute levels won't matter much in the long run. COST is a company set to continue higher and if my assumption is that markets will be higher in the future, then so will Costco stock. However, investors should be cautious during this macro-sentiment crisis through next Wednesday.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

3099,6149,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-streaming-access-disney-vault-195807140.html?.tsrc=rss,Disney+ Streaming to Include Access to the Disney Vault,2019-03-07,"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the undisputed leader in the video streaming market. Its early arrival to the scene, vast library of content licensed from TV and movie studios and growing collection of original programming have netted the company 139 million subscribers. The value of Netflix stock has increased over 6,100% in the past decade. But the company faces a big challenge in the form of Disney's (NYSE:DIS) new streaming service which will launch later this year. That challenge just got even more formidable with news that Disney+ will offer the entire catalog of Disney's animated movies -- the so-called &quot;Disney Vault.&quot;Source: Disney With the opening of &quot;the vault&quot; J.P. Morgan is predicting Disney+ will eventually draw 160 million subscribers globally.  Disney+ Just Got Even More Threatening for NetflixDisney+ is the new video streaming service that's set to debut in late 2019. The confirmation that Disney+ had a name and would be launching this year was enough to help set Netflix stock back nearly 3% last November.   * 5 Reasons Stocks Are Falling Right Now When Disney launches its video streaming service, it will do so with a considerable library of movies and TV content from its Disney, ABC and recently acquired Fox properties. That includes popular movies franchises like Star Wars and the Marvel movies. And all of these titles will be yanked from Netflix this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe situation for Netflix just got a little more unpleasant on news that Disney+ will also offer all the classic animated movies from the Disney Vault. This includes titles ranging from Cinderella to Aladdin.J.P Morgan released an investor note yesterday predicting that Disney's popularity globally, the company's marketing ability, and the massive content library available for its streaming video service will see Disney+ eventually hit 160 million subscribers. That will make it a serious rival to Netflix. With Disney+ expected to undercut Netflix on monthly subscription costs (even more noticeable after the company hiked rates to start off 2019), it will put additional pressure on NFLX.  Why the Disney Vault Is ImportantWhat's the big deal about the Disney Vault and how can its collection -- the company has only produced 57 animated feature films -- make such a big difference for the Disney+ prospects?Disney has carefully managed the distribution of these movies since the days of VHS movies releases, continuing through DVD, Blu-Ray and into streaming. The result has been what The Verge describes as a deliberate artificial shortage of these popular movies. Titles are available in a format for a short period of time before being put back in &quot;the vault&quot; and then consumers are forced to wait -- or pay big dollars for used copies. By opening up the vault and making all of those animated classics available to Disney+ subscribers, DIS is making its streaming video service look like a must-have for millions of Disney fans who don't already own the complete library of movies. And it will have instant appeal to families, whose children frequently watch the Disney classics over and over. 2019 Will Kick Off a Serious Video Streaming Video WarUp until now, Netflix has not had to face truly serious competition for video subscribers. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has over 100 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. -- and they get Amazon Prime video as part of the deal. But Amazon Prime video is more of a perk than a video streaming service that competes directly with Netflix on a subscriber basis. There are lots of smaller services as well, but none that come close to the numbers Netflix puts up. But in 2019, Netflix will face big challenges. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is getting in the game, but Disney+ is the real threat. J.P. Morgan thinks the result will be too many streaming services, resulting in a shakeout, but Disney's new service will thrive:&quot;While there is little question there are more direct-to-consumer services today than ultimately should survive, we have no doubt that Disney+ remains on the short list of products that should prevail longer-term.&quot;  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble Good news if you've been itching to watch Alice in Wonderland and your VHS copy is gathering dust on a shelf, probably not so great if you own Netflix stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But we continue to muddle through this area of &quot;chop&quot; as investors search for direction. Let's look at some top stock trades while we're at it. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: TeslaPlunging more than 8% on Friday, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is under pressure after the company introduced its $35,000 Model 3 and said it's unlikely to turn a profit in the first quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism Above is a six-month chart, a smaller timeframe than we usually use for Tesla. Below $290 and I would have some concern that support is giving way. Downtrend resistance (blue line) is clearly pressuring Tesla, and below support could spell a test of the $250 to $260 lows. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Nasdaq ETFLet's look at tech, via the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ). Despite seemingly everyone calling for a pullback in the market, stocks have continued to gravitate higher. This tough &quot;chop&quot; has made it difficult for swing traders, with a number of false moves (higher and lower) frustrating a number of people.Is the QQQ setting up for a run to $180+ now? It could be, particularly as uptrend support and the 200-day moving average are still intact. Above the 21-day and it's hard to get too bearish on QQQ and tech.But here's why the QQQ is so important: If this ETF starts to push higher, it can create big-time breakouts in individual stocks, like the two names belowâ¦ Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: AppleApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) are some of the market's biggest companies. With Apple, this name has been consolidating in a miraculously tight range.Over uptrend support and the 21-day moving average, and it's hard to be bearish on Apple. On a breakout over $175, this stock could start to garner some momentum. I am long Apple for its great business, but also separately in anticipation of this potential breakout. Below the 21-day and I'll reconsider my trade. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: AmazonAmazon and GOOGL are both setting up similarly, so let's just cover one of them. These big names have all been very quietly consolidating, while a number of other medium- and small-cap stocks have been posting the big moves. If they start to move in unison, it could trigger some big moves in both directions.I like that AMZN has made a big move over the 100-day moving average, as Amazon could be gearing up for a move to the $1,725 to $1,750 area. Above that and Amazon can really start to fly. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: KrogerAmazon launching a grocery chain is weighing on Kroger (NYSE:KR), which is down over 4% on the day. It's good that shares are bouncing from the $27 to $27.50 support area and are holding onto uptrend support (black line). That said, KR is hanging by a thread.The move below all of its major moving averages and its threat to break down from its tightening range -- a series of higher lows and lower highs -- has me thinking $26 could be coming sooner rather than later.  * 7 March Madness Stocks to Consider for the Big Dance Watch ~$27.25. Below that and $26 is on deck. All said, the tech names look more enticing to me.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

The smart speaker segment was developed by AMZN. The company has been able to grow its market dominance despite the entry of new competitors. The growth trajectory of this segment and Amazon's leadership should help the bullish sentiment towards Amazon stock.Source: Shutterstock The recent CIRP report mentions that the smart speaker installed base has expanded from 36 million to 66 million in the last year. Currently, Amazon Echo has market share of 70%, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home has 24% and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL)HomePod has 6%. The report also mentions the growing trend of multiple smart speaker within a single household. There is also a high degree of brand loyalty which should allow Amazon to improve its market share while the overall market size increases. As the market saturates, Amazon could move towards higher priced products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism This is a mini &quot;iPhone moment&quot; for Amazon. The company will be able to report rapid growth in revenue and bottom line as new devices are added to the smart home portfolio. Investors should look at the long term potential of this segment to gauge the growth possibility in Amazon's stock. Explosive GrowthThe last few quarters have seen tremendous growth within the smart speaker market. Customers seem to be attracted to this new device with increasing usage for various queries, shopping as well as listening to music and video. This segment was practically started by Amazon. Reports have suggested that the company was working on smart speakers as early as 2010 in its Lab126. Hence, it is not a surprise that Amazon has been able to keep its momentum in this segment by launching new devices which are useful for customers.Fig: Increase in smart speaker market over the last few quarters. Source: CIRPFig: More customers are choosing multiple speakers for their homes. Source: CIRPIn the last year, the installed base has increased by 83%. One of the reasons for this growth is that customers are opting for multiple devices within the same household to give better coverage in different parts of the house. This trend has increased the total addressable market size for this device. Instead of looking at only 125 million households in US, Amazon can try to have multiple devices per households.It should be noted that Amazon Echo had a slight disadvantage in this market compared to its competitor Google Home which has a much better search algorithm due to its core search platform. However, Amazon Echo has been to negate this disadvantage by offering better Alexa options and also seamlessly linking the Echo with Amazon's retail operation.The ability to maintain segment leadership while competing against giants like Google and Apple is highly favorable for Amazon stock. Impact on Top Line We can see from CIRP's chart that the installed base of Amazon's smart speaker has increased by 20 million in the last one year. Assuming an average selling price of $60, the top line contribution of Echo devices would be $1.2 billion. Amazon has also launched these devices in almost all the international markets where it has a presence. These markets should also provide good contribution to overall sales.As the market continues to expand, the incremental sales of Echo products could easily increase to over 50 million annually. Further increase in ASP of these echo devices to $100 should add incremental revenue of $5 billion from the domestic market alone. After adding the sales from international market and addition of new devices to this segment, Amazon should be in a position to report $10 billion worth of sales by FY 2021 from this segment. This would be a big boost to the top line of the company which is showing signs of a slowdown. Bottom Line and Amazon StockHowever, the bigger impact of Echo sales would be on the bottom line. There is already a trend towards more premium smart speaker products. Both Amazon and Google have launched their premium smart speakers. Amazon's Echo Plus is available for $150, Echo Show is priced at $230 while Google Home Max has a price of $350. After saturating the lower tier we should see both Amazon and Google increase the pricing in the next generation of these devices. An iPhone-like margin is still far away, but a gradual increase in prices should certainly improve the margins of these devices. Rapidly increasing revenue base and margins from smart home devices should help in growth of EPS and drive Amazon stock higher.Improvement in the ecosystem should also make these devices a must-have product. This ends up increasing the pricing power of Amazon. Echo owners also shop more on Amazon due to the seamless integration of its ecommerce platform with Echo. This reduces the price comparison which shoppers do before making a purchase. Hence, a growing number of Echo users who shop on Amazon should give the company greater pricing power for the goods sold on its platform. We should see better margins and operating income in Amazon's ecommerce segment due to this trend. Investor TakeawayAmazon's Echo sales are growing rapidly. The company holds market leadership in a segment which is growing in domestic as well as international markets. We should see more premium products in this segment in the next few years. This will improve the margins and revenue for Amazon. Echo devices also improves Amazon's ecosystem which should allow the company to launch new smart home devices and new services.Wall Street is concerned about slowing sales momentum in the company which has impacted Amazon stock. But the company should be able to deliver new revenue streams through the growth of new devices in smart home segment. Overall improvement in margins will also improve the bullish sentiment around Amazon stock. I have a strong buy rating for the company.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

These numbers show a smartwatch market that surged 56% in Q4 2018 as consumer interest grew in the advanced wearables. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains the leader, but the Apple Watch is losing its dominance as rivals catch up. In particular, Samsung and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) are gaining ground on Apple watch sales.Source: Apple The stakes are high, especially for Apple and Fitbit. Apple stock is feeling the effect of slowing iPhone sales, while Fitbit has been in a struggle for survival -- caught between the Apple Watch and cheap fitness trackers from China's Xiaomi and others. 2018 Global Smartwatch Market Shows Apple Watch Sales Pace Slowing  Strategy Analytics released its report on Global smartwatch shipments for Q4 and full-year 2018. They reveal a market showing impressive growth. According to Strategy Analytics' estimates, global shipments hit a record 45 million units in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018 alone, 18.2 million units shipped for a 56% increase compared to Q4 2017.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Apple retained its leadership position in 2018. Shipment estimates are 9.2 million units for Q4 (AAPL doesn't release actual Apple Watch sales numbers), up from 7.8 million the prior year. The 22.5 million units the company shipped for all of 2018 give it a 51% share of the global smartwatch market for 2018. However, that figure is way down from its 67.2% market share in the year-ago period. Samsung, Fitbit Gain GroundThe big winners in 2018 are Samsung and Fitbit. Not that long ago Fitbit appeared to be on the ropes when its first smartwatch entry -- the Ionic -- failed to catch on as hoped, while fitness tracker sales slumped. With the Versa added to the lineup, however, smartwatch revenue surpassed fitness tracker revenue for the company for the first time in Q2 2018.In fact, Fitbit said that the Versa was its fastest selling product ever. In Q4 2017, Fitbit's smartwatch shipments were just 500,000 units. But in Q4 2018, Strategy Analytics has the number pegged at 2.3 million, with a total of 5.5 million for the year. That's just a quarter of Apple Watch sales numbers, but an impressive growth rate and enough to edge out Samsung to take second place in 2018 global smartwatch shipments.Samsung also saw strong growth, particularly in Q4 where it shipped 2.4 million units compared to 600,000 in Q4 2017. The company continues to offer a strong smartwatch lineup that is frequently refreshed. Its latest -- the Galaxy Watch Active -- was just announced a week ago.It seems positioned to be a headache for Apple Watch sales, with integrated blood pressure monitoring (something AAPL can't yet do) and a $199.99 price tag that's half the cost of the cheapest Apple Watch Series 4.The fourth biggest smartwatch vendor is Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), which has built a niche selling rugged smartwatches aimed at the fitness and outdoor activity market. The company maintained its fourth place spot, but saw modest growth and ultimately captured 7.1% of the market for 2018. Strategy Analytics says:&quot;Rising competition from Fitbit, Samsung and others in the sports and music categories is making it harder for Garmin to make headway in smartwatches.&quot; Smartwatch Market ConsolidationIt's getting tough at this point for companies to break into the smartwatch market. Combined, the top four companies accounted for over 80% of all smartwatches shipped, worldwide.If you look at that top four, you'll notice that none are associated with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division. Google's Wear OS continues to be a smartwatch platform that's failing to gain any momentum.Wear OS should have a significant advantage because it supports Android -- which powers 85% of all smartphones -- and can also be used with iOS. Apple Watch sales are limited to consumers who own an iPhone â¦Despite the Android numbers advantage, Apple Watch sales remain strong enough for AAPL to be the world's number one smartwatch vendor in 2018. That's good news for investors who are looking for other products to take the pressure off iPhone sales and help future Apple stock growth.However, Apple's slowing momentum and slipping dominance show the company needs to keep innovating if it wants to hold onto the smartwatch crown it's worn since the Apple Watch launched in 2015.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3222,6379,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-great-semiconductor-stocks-buy-145507112.html?.tsrc=rss,3 Great Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now,2019-02-26,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in August 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]It's not hard to see why investors have been worried about chip makers in recent months. Several of the trends that had powered them in recent quarters and years are starting to fade. The group of chip makers tied to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example, have lost momentum as the global smartphone market looks increasingly saturated. Expectations for other trends that had been powering increased semiconductor demand, such as cryptocurrencies and Internet of Things (IoT), are being reigned in.On top of that, until late last year, semiconductor stocks were among the hottest groups in the market since 2016. A pause in their momentum is not a big surprise. That said, given the recent underperformance of the sector, it could be time to go fishing for a little value. And yes, that means steering clear of the controversial and expensive high-fliers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in search of more compelling value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Here are three such semiconductor stocks to buy today. Semiconductor Stocks: Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) suffered from a bit of unwanted publicity last year. Its new CEO, Brian Crutcher, resigned due to personal conduct issues less than two months after being promoted to the role.Texas Instruments has reinstated long-time top executive Rich Templeton, who guided the company to great prosperity in recent years, to the CEO role indefinitely. While the management shake-up may have made some investors nervous, TXN's core business keeps on humming. Last quarter, its earnings per share beat expectations, although its top line came in slightly below analysts' consensus outlook.With the string of earnings-per-share growth in recent years, Texas Instruments now tops $100 billion in market cap. It dominates its niche: analog chips that process real-world measurable data for digital applications. It continues building out its patent library, manufacturing capabilities and product lines with additional acquisitions. As such, it has achieved massive scale and can continue plugging more products into its platform.Texas Instruments has its fingers in many pies, with its efforts in automotive and communications chips showing particular promise given current market trends. Additionally, the company has more security and recurring revenue than most chipmakers, as its products tend to have much longer lifecycles than the sorts of designs that go into hot consumer products such as phones.TXN stock has soared in recent years; it's up from $50 to more than $100 just since early 2016. But the fun isn't over yet.TXN stock sells for 18 times its forward earnings. Combine that with its 15% projected five-year EPS growth rate, and TXN is a reasonably priced tech growth company. On top of that, the company pays a market-beating dividend yield of 2.85%. Semiconductor Stocks: Intel (INTC)AMD's recent gains have, to some extent, been Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) pain. While AMD stock has soared over the last year, INTC stock is up less than 10% during that time.The comparative weakness of INTC stock is a buying opportunity.The market has grown concerned about repeated delays with Intel's line of 10nm technology. For the first time in many years, it appears that AMD is reaching technological parity with Intel across both the server and laptop markets. AMD's market share could draw much closer to that of Intel in coming quarters.However, don't count Intel out anytime soon. The company still has far more resources and R&D prowess than AMD. While its delays with this product cycle have been embarrassing, they can and will be fixed. And as it is, there is more to performance than just the nanometer size of chips -- Intel's current generation of products are still highly competitive.INTC stock is selling at 12 times its trailing and 11 times its forward earnings. The company's dividend is also close to 2.5%.  * 7 IPOs to Get Excited for in 2019 Take advantage of temporary competitive issues against AMD to score INTC stock at a nice price. Semiconductor Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), like Texas Instruments, has also had some excitement in recent months. Qualcomm finally abandoned its long-running attempt to take over NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). This acquisition would have broadly diversified Qualcomm's business. Investors have looked nervously at Qualcomm's concentration in patent-based revenues as its own chips have fallen prey, in some cases, to OEM competition.However, there was also a good deal of execution risk in the proposed mega-merger. So China's influence in scuttling the deal could come out as a plus. As it is, Qualcomm still gets huge royalties off of 3G and 4G technology, and it has an enviable position in the upcoming rollout of 5G.Shareholders will get a concentrated ownership position on these assets. That's because Qualcomm -- now that the NXP deal is dead -- announced a gigantic buyback of up to $30 billion by the end of 2019.Considering Qualcomm's current $64 billion market cap, we're talking about the company retiring something along the lines of over 40% of outstanding QCOM stock. On top of that, QCOM stock offers a large dividend yield, currently almost 4.7%, making it one of the top income plays in the tech space.  The all-time high of QCOM stock is up around $80, offering substantial upside as a target, especially as the rest of its buyback kicks in.As of this writing, Ian Bezek owned shares of TXN, INTC and QCOM stock.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday.AirPods 2 Launch: A new rumor claims to reveal exactly when the AirPods 2 will launch, reports BGR. According to this rumor, Apple will be releasing the AirPods 2 on March 29. The rumor claims the wireless earbuds will go up for preorder on March 22 and will be announced in a press event earlier that week. It also says that the tech company will be releasing other new hardware on March 29. However, it doesn't say what this new hardware might be.German iPhone Sales: Apple is back to selling the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines in Germany, AppleInsider notes. The company is now selling modified versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 family of smartphones. These versions include modems from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). This is the company's way of getting around a sales ban on these devices in the country. The sale ban is part of an ongoing legal battle between AAPL and QCOM.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNews Subscription: Apple is reportedly having trouble getting newspapers on board with its News subscription service, reports MacRumors. This is reportedly due to the revenue split for the service. AAPL will take 50% of the revenue and the other 50% will be split between publishers. This will have the remaining 50% being split based on the amount of time users spend on articles from publishers. Magazine publishers are reportedly happy with the 50/50 split, but major newspaper outlets are against it.Check out more recent Apple Rumors or Subscribe to Apple Rumors : RSS As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

3328,6866,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-buys-eero-wants-consumers-173545648.html?.tsrc=rss,Amazon Buys Eero; Wants Consumers to Trust It With Their Internet Activity,2019-02-11,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already the connected smart home leader, thanks to its Echo smart speakers and accessories like its Cloud Cam security cameras and Ring doorbell cams. But now the company is going after the &quot;connected&quot; part of the equation. Yesterday evening, AMZN announced that it is buying Eero, a startup that helped to kick off the popularity of mesh Wi-Fi routers.So, what does this acquisition mean for both Amazon and Eero? Amazon Announces Eero AcquisitionJust an hour after markets closed on Monday, Amazon sent out a press release announcing it had signed an agreement to acquire Eero, a startup that makes mesh Wi-Fi routers. Founded in 2014, San Francisco-based Eero was first to market with a mesh Wi-Fi system for the home.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * Buy These 5 Stocks to Play the Megatrend of the Century AMZN's SVP of Amazon Devices and Services had this to say:&quot;We are incredibly impressed with the eero team and how quickly they invented a WiFi solution that makes connected devices just work. We have a shared vision that the smart home experience can get even easier, and we're committed to continue innovating on behalf of customers.&quot;Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Why Buy a Router company â¦ And Why Eero?For Amazon, buying Eero solidifies its position as a dominant smart home player. It leaped to the smart home forefront with the success of its Echo smart speakers and Fire TV media streamers. From there, the company began to methodically fill out its smart home offerings, with a growing range of Alexa-powered smart devices, and the release of its Cloud Cam indoor security cameras.Amazon also acquired other successful companies that specialized in smart home products. Just over a year ago, Amazon bought Ring, a startup that made a popular smart doorbell.All of these connected, smart home devices rely on Wi-Fi. So it only makes sense that Amazon would want the ability to control that aspect as well. And the way to do that is by offering its own Wi-Fi routers.Doing so lets Amazon sell a complete package to consumers, and by controlling the router the company also has the opportunity to tweak performance to improve its connected smart products.That's a move that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google already made with its Google WiFi routers.Why choose Eero? There are several reasons.The primary one is that Eero is a mesh Wi-Fi pioneer. Mesh routers tend to be more expensive than traditional Wi-Fi routers, but they have big advantages. Mesh systems offer blanket wireless coverage for a home, and they're designed to deliver performance with a large number of devices connected -- ideal for smart home setups.Mesh systems are also smaller and designed to blend in with home decor, they tend to be easier to set up, and once running they are highly automated including automatic security updates.Google WiFi is a mesh system, and Amazon would want its own solution to match its primary smart home competitor's. As a small company focused on one thing -- mesh home Wi-Fi routers -- Eero would be easier to integrate into Amazon's lineup than other companies that offer mesh routers as part of a larger product line. Not to mention less expensive (not that Amazon, with its deep pockets, couldn't afford a larger acquisition).Finally, Eero is popular and its products are well regarded. Apple's Router Strategy Is â¦ Out of SyncWith the Eero acquisition, Amazon and Google are now both in the home Wi-Fi game. Another tech giant is noticeably missing from that picture: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Ironically, Apple was actually a long-time maker of home Wi-Fi routers. It had been selling its Airport line of Wi-Fi routers since 1999 before beginning to wind down the division in 2016 and soon exiting the business altogether. After making a name for selling stylish and easy to operate home Wi-Fi routers, Apple no longer has a presence in the market -- just as the Wi-Fi-powered smart home is taking off, and its primary smart home competitors are offering routers of their own.Apple's strategy seems a little out of sync here â¦There's no word on whether AMZN will re-brand Eero once the acquisition is finalized, or keep the name for its new mesh Wi-Fi routers. The company will have to deal with several challenges in selling its own routers. The first is pricing: at $279 for the base unit, Eero is $150 more than the base Google WiFi system.  * The 7 Best Video Game Stocks to Power Up Your Portfolio!

Of course, SQ stock has been a reliable winner over the years, although it swoons occasionally. Since SQ went public in early 2016, the price of Square stock has gone from $9 to $72.

The company's focus on small businesses has been spot-on. By leveraging mobile devices from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), SQ has been able to amass a large base of customers. But the company has also launched add-on offerings like e-commerce, gift cards, payroll, employee management, inventory, scheduling, etc.

In the third quarter, SQ's revenues shot up by a sizzling 68% to $431 million. Its top line handily beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, whose average estimate was $414 million.

Yet it will certainly be tough for SQ to maintain that blistering growth. In fact, its top-line increases could slow soon.

Consider a recent research note from Raymond James analyst John Davis on Square stock. According to the analyst, SQ does not have any upcoming product offerings that will generate revenue growth. Davis adds that the company's acquisitions of Weebly and Zesty are likely to weigh on its bottom line.

Davis concludes his note on Square stock by writing: &quot;We believe organic growth peaked in 3Q18 and growth on the all-important subs and services line will likely materially decelerate in 2Q19. We believe the risk/reward is negatively skewed and recommend investors reduce positions.&quot;

He downgraded Square stock from &quot;Market Perform&quot; to &quot;Underperform&quot; and lowered his price target on SQ stock to $56.

### Square's Competition

There are plenty of companies that are gunning for Square's customers. For example, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has capitalized on its QuickBooks business to provide loans to small businesses. While its loan initiative is still in the early stages, it has gained a great deal of traction so far.

Then there is PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The company's payments business continues to grow at a rapid pace, led by its Venmo app, which has become a must-have for Millennials. PYPL is also acquiring iZettle, which is a leading player in merchant processing systems for smartphones and tablets in Europe.

Even traditional financial institutions are becoming a major factor in the digital payments industry. A consortium of banks - including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), Capital One (NYSE:COF), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC), US Bank (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) - have developed a digital-payments app called Zelle. No doubt, the app has gotten a nice boost from its wide distribution. Consider that the volume of BAC's Zelle offering has more than doubled over the past year.

Finally, there was the recent merger between Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) and First Data (NYSE:FDC), which are major credit-card processors. The companies made the deal mainly to more effectively take on Square. The combined company plans to spend $500 million over the next five years on new technologies.

### The Valuation of Square Stock

SQ stock is far from cheap. The market cap of Square stock stands at $30 billion, and it has a price-sales ratio of nine. And if Square's growth decelerates and SQ starts to look more like a bank, the valuation of Square stock is likely to drop

What's more, it's important to note that Davis is not the only Wall Street analyst who is skeptical about Square stock. BTIG's Mark Palmer and Giuliano Bologna have a price target of $30 on Square stock!

That may be a bit extreme. But then again, the average price target on SQ stock is roughly $78, which assumes only about 11% upside from current levels.

They might not always make things look pretty -- and that last game was ugly -- but they usually find a way. For shareholders of GOOGL stock, they enjoy a similar level of confidence.

In the first half of last year, shares of the tech giant were slowly gaining momentum during a tumultuous period. But between August through December-end, Alphabet stock dropped roughly 15%.

When other tech names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suffered even worse declines, many folks doubted GOOGL.

However, the internet stalwart is off to a great start in 2019, having gained nearly 9% year-to-date. In addition, we're seeing generally strong enthusiasm for GOOGL stock heading into the company's fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report.

More than likely, we're going to see a healthy dose of the usual suspects; namely, its search engine and advertisement platforms.

### GOOGL Stock Offers Diversified Exposure

But over the past few months, Alphabet stock has become a much more diversified investment. Particularly, its Waymo driverless taxi service is extraordinarily compelling. While I still hold some reservations regarding the marriage of artificial intelligence and human transportation, I can't deny the potential.

Recently, an unexpected car repair forced me to use Uber for the first time. The rapid-fire service and reasonable fare left a very positive impression on me. But I also realized that Uber in its current form had limitations: human drivers.

With an automated service, I can order a ride anytime, anywhere. I don't have to worry if the driver is drunk or distracted, for instance.

Of course, Waymo is unlikely to move the needle for the fourth-quarter, as it's too early in the development phase. However, it does provide management with a viable narrative other than its advertisement revenue, which may have hit some speed bumps.

Another talking point is the company's push into the hardware business. Alphabet is already a key player in the smart-speaker business. Due to its natural synergies, I expect it to maintain its dominance, thereby bolstering the case for GOOGL stock.

And despite Apple's recent jump higher, I believe Alphabet smells blood in the smartphone arena. With the iPhone maker struggling with &quot;peak smartphone,&quot; GOOGL could possibly reinvigorate the sector with fresh and cheaper products.

### GOOGL Earnings Might Face Turbulence

At the same time, nothing occurs in a vacuum. Alphabet stock will still feel the broader effects of the U.S.-China trade war, as well as general economic uneasiness. Despite reasonable profitability and growth targets for Q4, GOOGL might experience some turbulence.

For earnings per share, analysts peg consensus at $10.82. This is toward the higher end of the estimate spectrum, which ranges from $9.28 to $12.13. In the year-ago quarter, Alphabet delivered $9.70, missing its consensus forecast of $9.96. Coincidentally, GOOGL stock also came up short in Q4 2016.

On the revenue side, analysts expect the internet firm to haul in $38.7 billion. Again, this is near the higher end of estimates, which range between $31.5 billion to $39.6 billion. In Q4 2017, Alphabet generated $25.9 billion.

Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't question the tech giant's ability to meet and exceed these key metrics. But within the past three months, we've witnessed multiple downward revisions in both earnings and revenues.

Additionally, Amazon has consistently flexed its muscles in the advertisement front. According to Monica Peart, senior director of eMarketer, Amazon is busy &quot;chipping away at search ad dollars that were once going to Google.&quot;

Finally, we can't deny that the broader tech sector has mostly hemorrhaged badly in recent months. While I remain bullish long-term on companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), we must respect what the market is telling us.

### Be Patient With Alphabet Stock

So how should we approach GOOGL stock with earnings just around the corner? If you're in this for the long haul, you may want to consider adding a modest position now.

Despite some profitability and revenue headwinds, I ultimately see Alphabet stock growing into a well-diversified investment. In prior years, I could merely harp on its search-engine dominance, and craft myself a solid argument. Now, I have other avenues to discuss, along with proven track records.

Therefore, I wouldn't read too much into the immediate market movements. GOOGL is a patient investor's game, one that will marinate delectably over time.

Other U.S. companies that do business in China were put on notice. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of those companies.

China's fast-growing consumer market has been the focal point of the SBUX's expansion efforts for years. And until last year, the company's growth there had been outstanding. Apple's red flag left most owners of Starbucks stock wondering if that growth streak had come to a complete halt.

But it didn't. Growth remains agonizingly slow, but Starbucks continues to make some measure of forward progress in the increasingly important market.

  * 5 Top Stocks for a FOMO Rally 



There's still a major concern SBUX stock holders should note about Starbucks' primary growth vehicle. And it's got nothing to do with trade tensions or an economic slowdown in China.

### Earnings Hint at a Headwind

Thursday morning's quarterly report shed a great deal of light on what had been an uncertain matter.

For its fiscal first quarter ending in December, Starbucks turned $6.6 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of 75 cents.

Both were better than expected, and both were well up on a year-over-year basis. The pros were only modeling income of 65 cents per share of Starbucks stock and a top line of $6.49 billion, and the company only posted a profit of 65 cents per share on sales of $6.1 billion for the same quarter a year earlier.

Starbucks' bright spot? Everywhere except China.

Globally, same-store sales improved by 4%, while the average orders size was up 3% year-over-year. Those same figures apply to its broad China/Asia Pacific division, but in spite of China, where comparable store sales were only up 1% and the total number of transactions fell 2%.

The knee-jerk explanation is China's demonstrable economic slowdown, which has tapped the brakes on the country's consumerism.

The data may also underscore another challenge, however -- consumers outside of the major metropolitan areas where Starbucks stores are readily found don't earn as much as the China's urbanites do, and as such may not be regulars at some of the company's newer locales.

Or, maybe China's coffee drinkers are simply getting their caffeine fix somewhere else.

### Enter Luckin Coffee

It's not a name anyone will see on a sign in the United States, but in China it's become relatively difficult not to notice the more than 2000 Luckin Coffee locations peppered all across the country. Starbucks is still bigger, with almost 3700 stores in China. But, Luckin says it plans to roughly double its store count before the end of the year, surpassing Starbucks in the process.

It's audacious, but not unachievable, for an unprofitable startup that isn't yet concerned about turning a profit.

Worse (for Starbucks stock holders), of all the Luckin's already up and running, about 1100 of them are within a quarter of a mile of a Starbucks, offering a less-costly alternative. It would be naive to believe the presence of Luckin hasn't taken some sort of toll on Starbucks' business in China, and will certainly continue taking a toll as it expands.

Adding to that pressure is that Luckin has found ways to set up shops in key places where Starbacks couldn't, include the Palace Museum and on several university campuses.

They're not carbon copies of another, to be fair. Starbucks is largely about the ambience, and Luckin Coffee stores have none. They're built from the ground up to be run by a lean crew that doesn't accept cash. Rather, it's a grab-n-go setup, or better still, Luckin will deliver the order.

Starbucks is also offering deliveries, in partnership with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) property Ele.me. The benefit of that service isn't decidedly making a positive impact on business though.

### Looking Ahead for Starbucks Stock

So far, the rise of Luckin has been mostly dismissed by analysts. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Eric Gonzalez recently noted there's &quot;room for both competitors to thrive long-term. China per-capita coffee consumption is less than one cup/year compared to 300 cups in the U.S.&quot; Starbucks itself, meanwhile, has commented very little on its new competitor, and doesn't seem to be terribly worried.

That doesn't mean current or prospective owners of Starbucks stock shouldn't worry though. Several Western-minded companies thought they had a firm grip on China's consumers after some initial success in the market. But, too many of them learned too late they weren't quite ready to service China's highly disparate consumers. A few of these outfits found out the hard way they were effectively training their competitors to beat them at their own game.

This, in turn, has made investors question the growth prospects behind Apple stock's longer-term story.

An Apple spokesman called the move a &quot;reshuffling,&quot; saying the company was still interested in &quot;autonomous systems.&quot;

This was preceded by analysts writing the project was being scrapped and by one of its leads, Alexander Hitzinger, being poached by Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAY).

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The move is considered fallout from the &quot;failure&quot; of the Apple XR iPhone model to take off during the holidays, and a memo to employees from CEO Tim Cook promising action.

For Apple stock owners, this seemed to underscore the wisdom of a selloff that followed its September earnings report, which eventually lobbed-off nearly one-third of Apple's market cap. Its value entering trade Jan. 25 was about $722 billion. It had been over $1 trillion.

But reports of Apple's death are greatly exaggerated, as is the doom and gloom surrounding AAPL stock.

### Whither the Self-Driving Car?

The move by AAPL led to speculation that technology for self-driving cars remains years away.  This specuation came despite numerous tests, including the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo launch of a fleet of self-driving taxis in Phoenix, and its opening of a factory near Detroit to outfit vehicles for autonomous use.

While it's true that fully autonomous cars are still confused by things like rain, and having no driver leaves them vulnerable to attack by Luddites, the technology continues to move ahead.

Rather than Apple deciding against the technology, it may be that the technology is just not for Apple â¦ at least not in that form.

A host of companies, both on the car side and the tech side, are chasing full vehicle autonomy. Apple's version, seen in October, did not seem especially innovative.

### AAPL Stock: Where's the Growth?

At its opening price of $157 per share, AAPL stock was selling for under 13 times earnings, despite having over $200 billion in cash and securities. This is the position it was in back in 2014, when Cook decided to split AAPL stock, launch a dividend and commit to spending big on cloud data centers.

Apple still uses third-party data centers, including those of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet, for storing raw files, retaining the metadata, while it puts $10 billion more into such centers, having already built in Nevada, North Carolina and China.

Apple has also begun the laborious process of getting Food and Drug Administration approval for medical applications on the Apple Watch, starting with its EKG sensor. I have written a number of times that health applications, identifying and monitoring chronic conditions, are where Apple's next trillion dollars will come from, and it now dominates wearables with 4.7 million units shipped in the September quarter alone.

### The Bottom Line on Apple Stock

It took about 30 years for the PC to reach &quot;technical exhaustion,&quot; prices falling below $500 as new capabilities proved not worth paying for. After PCs reached this point, it took Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) years to settle on a new, cloud-based growth path. At its nadir, Microsoft was selling for multiples little different from where Apple stock is now. Assuming it meets December's estimates, Microsoft will be selling for about 22 times earnings.

  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy ... According to Goldman Sachs 



It has taken the smartphone just 10 years to reach technical exhaustion, a point made clear by the Apple's XR &quot;failure.&quot; But notwithstanding its retreat on self-driving cars, AAPL is further along in recreating itself than Microsoft was.

Young investors will have time to take advantage, because analysts are still going to see AAPL stock through the prism of the iPhone until it becomes obvious that cloud services and the Watch can make the company grow again. Their patience will be rewarded.

During this stretch, Starbucks stock is up 7%.

Things didn't look as good at the beginning of 2019. To kick off the year, one of the world's largest companies, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), fired a warning shot about rapidly slowing growth in China -- the world's hottest economy. Stocks broadly fell after that warning shot. But, it's been nothing but up, up, and away for markets since then. Following the Apple-led market selloff in early January, the S&P 500 has rallied an impressive 8% in under three weeks.

But while Starbucks is up nearly that much, SBUX investors shouldn't be forgetting the Apple warning shot so soon. To be frank, Starbucks stock should not have been part of the broad market rally in January. The reality is that Starbucks, much like Apple, is a company on a slowing growth trend with worrisome exposure to the slowing China economy. As such, first quarter numbers -- due after the bell on Thursday, January 24 -- won't be very good, and they will likely include an Apple-like warning about slowing China growth going forward.

  * 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider 



That negative update isn't priced into Starbucks stock. Thus, not only could Starbucks fall after Q1 earnings, but it could also fall by quite a bit.

All together, while Starbucks is a long-term growth company that will ultimately head higher in a multi-year window, caution is warranted on Starbucks stock ahead of Q1 earnings.

### The Numbers May Disappoint

Last quarter, Starbucks reported headline revenue and earnings beats with above-consensus comparable sales growth and a healthy guide. The theme of the conference call was that expansion in the China market would offset slowing growth in U.S. market, and reinvigorate the overall growth narrative. Investors rallied around that idea. Starbucks stock has done nothing but grind higher since then.

That puts Starbucks stock in a precarious position heading into Q1 earnings.

If anything has become clear since the last earnings report, it is that the Chinese economy is dramatically cooling off. Apple cut its quarterly guide in a big way due to slowing growth in China. China reported 6.6% GDP growth in 2018, the lowest annual pace in nearly 30 years. Q4 GDP growth was 6.4%, the slowest quarterly pace since the Financial Crisis. Other economic data coming out of China has been weak, including retail-sales growth rates hovering at 15 year lows.

This is all bad news for Starbucks stock. The core of the near term bull thesis on SBUX is that China growth is going to pave a brighter future for this company, which has struggled with slowing growth over the past several years.

But, that probably isn't happening yet. It's highly unlikely that Starbucks is bucking the broader China economic trend and putting up strong numbers in China. As such, China numbers this quarter will likely disappoint. If they do, the numbers globally will disappoint, too. Also, the tone on the conference call may be Apple-like, and include warnings about slowing growth going forward.

Overall, Starbucks is heading into an earnings report which has the potential to be pretty bad. That isn't a favorable setup for Starbucks stock, especially at current valuation levels.

### The Valuation Doesn't Incorporate Disappointment

At the end of the day, it always comes down to numbers and valuation. For example, despite significant sales pressure in China, Apple stock is a buy here because it's trading at just 12x forward earnings, and is priced for all the bad news.

That isn't true for Starbucks stock. Despite facing significant sales pressure in China like Apple, Starbucks stock doesn't trade at 12x forward earnings. Instead, it still trades at 25x forward earnings.

That is simply too big of a multiple for Starbucks stock. The whole restaurant industry trades at 22x forward earnings. Other major players in the quick service restaurant space like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Dunkin' (NYSE:DNKN), Yum(NYSE:YUM), Jack In The Box (NASDAQ:JACK) and El Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) all trade around 18 to 23x forward earnings.

In the past, Starbucks stock warranted a premium valuation because of higher quality growth. That is no longer the case today. Comparable sales growth last quarter was just 3%. That is largely an industry average comparable sales growth rate (McDonald's was up above 4% last quarter, and Yum was at 2%). Thus, this is no longer a higher quality growth company, meaning the stock no longer deserves its premium valuation. Compression to the norm valuation across the QSR space implies ~10% valuation downside risk.

### Bottom Line on SBUX Stock

In the long term, Starbucks stock is a winner, powered by global brand leadership in the steady growth coffee retail industry. But, in the near term, Starbucks stock seems due for a correction as it rallies into an earnings report that will likely disappoint due to slowing China growth.

As such, near term caution is warranted. But, post-earnings pullbacks towards the $60 level could quickly turn into buying opportunities.

Over the course of its 16 months on Wall Street, Roku stock price first went from $14 to $50, then dropped to $30, rallied to $80, dropped to $30 again, and rallied to $40, where it stands today.

The volatility of Roku stock can be chalked up to the enormous variation in Roku's potential future performance.

On one end, ROKU could become the face of streaming-service aggregation, turn into the cable box of the streaming world, and one day have hundreds of millions of active accounts, through which the company will collect billions of dollars from revenue sharing and ads. In this scenario, Roku stock could be worth a lot one day.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



Conversely, Roku could be squashed by competitors in this space, and rapidly lose active accounts and revenue. In this scenario, Roku stock could be worth nothing one day.

As a result, Roku stock could be worth nothing, in the future, it could be worth $20 billion-plus one day, or it could end up being worth anything in between. That's a wide range, so wide that it explains the high volatility of Roku stock price.

This volatility will eventually subside as the company's range of outcomes narrows in the future after it has grown. But the valuation of Roku stock will ultimately be at the upper end of the $0-$20 billion range, so the narrowing process will boost Roku stock.

### Positive Developments Make the Bull Thesis on Roku Stock More Likely

In late 2018, the market seemingly forgot that Roku is likely to remain a key component of the rapidly growing streaming market over the long-term. But in 2019, there have been multiple positive developments which have reminded investors that Roku is a growth company. Consequently, Roku stock has rallied this month.

First, Roku added paid subscriptions to Roku Channel, thereby allowing subscribers to watch paid programming from Showtime, Starz, and Epix through the Roku Channel. Second, Roku reported strong fourth-quarter engagement numbers that included a 40% increase in active accounts and nearly 70% growth of streaming hours. Third, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) backed out of plans to launch a streaming service, showing that streaming is hard to do, and that Roku has a big enough moat to keep big competitors away.

All together, these positive developments underscore that Roku continues to innovate, expand, and grow at a rapid rate, perhaps so quickly that it is deterring other companies from entering the space. That's a major positive development for Roku stock. It means that the bear thesis that competitors will squash Roku and Roku stock is overstated. It also means that the bull thesis of ROKU turning into a major streaming player continues to gain traction.

### Increased Size Will Bring Increased Stability

It's difficult to predict the long-term fate of small companies, so they tend to be highly volatile. As those small companies grow, though, investors gain visibility into their long-term outlook, the range of possible outcomes narrows, and their stocks become more stable.

This process will be favorable for ROKU.

Roku is really small right now. The company has just 27 million active accounts, versus Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) 140 million paid members. Thus, the question right now is whether Roku will grow to 140 million members like Netflix or lose its 27 million members to bigger competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Investors have been uncertain about the answer to that question. As a result, Roku bounced around wildly in 2017 and 2018.

These wild swings may slow in 2019. That's because ROKU has been a public company for six quarters and in each of those six quarters, its active account growth has been 40% or higher, while its streaming hours have increased by at least 50%.

That is consistent and healthy growth which underscores that, regardless of the surrounding competitive environment, Roku 's continued leverage of technology and network effects have enabled it to remain a leader of the streaming device market.

The longer Roku's growth remains consistent and large, the more likely the bulls' thesis will become, and the more investors will write off the bear thesis as inaccurate. As this happens, Roku stock price will rise, and at a much more steady and stable pace than has previously been the case.

### The Bottom Line on ROKU

ROKU has been highly volatile over the past 16 months because it's been a small company with a wide range of possible outcomes. But Roku is getting bigger, and is it does, it is becoming increasingly clear that this company has staying power in the streaming market, which is poised to grow over the long-term. The clearer that becomes, the higher Roku stock price will go.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ROKU, AAPL, and AMZN.

Further details about the new tablets, such as their specs, are still unknown and weren't included in the rumor.

iPhone XR Antenna: The next version of the iPhone XR may get a better antenna, AppleInsider notes. This rumor claims that the tech company will be equipping the 2019 successor to the iPhone XR with the same antenna that is in the iPhone XS. This would give the smartphone a better wireless connection. The iPhone XS uses a 4-by-4 MIMO antenna. The current iPhone XR only has a 2-by-2 MIMO antenna.

Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday.

AirPower: A reference to the AirPower has shown up on Apple's Malaysian website, reports AppleInsider. The reference to the AirPower shows up on the same page for the company's new Smart Battery Cases. The website mentions that the Smart Battery Cases are compatible with the &quot;AirPower Wireless Charging Mat and other Qi-certified chargers.&quot; This may hint that the AirPower is still coming out, and it may be sooner, rather than later.

Smart Battery Case: The Smart Battery Case for the iPhone XS doesn't work with the iPhone X, 9to5Mac notes. The iPhone XS and iPhone X share almost identical designs. So much so that the Smart Battery Case for the iPhone XS fits on the iPhone X. However, the device shows a compatibility error that keeps the case from working with the iPhone X. It's also worth noting that the holes for the speaker and microphone on the iPhone X are covered by the case.

The public bashing AAPL took after admitting to throttling iPhone performance was one thing. But the solution to the PR mess -- the $29 iPhone battery replacement program -- ended up being incredibly costly. Leaked info from an Apple all-hands meeting says that 11 million iPhone batteries were replaced under the program. And that may have cost AAPL billions of dollars in lost iPhone sales, contributing in a big way to the revenue downgrade that recently pummeled Apple stock.

At the start of January, Apple CEO Tim Cook held an all-hands company meeting. The company had just released a letter to investors warning of its &quot;biggest miss in years&quot; due to lower than expected iPhone sales, and as a result Apple stock was tanking.

In the letter, Cook had noted that the iPhone battery program was a factor, referencing &quot;some customers taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.&quot;

It turns out that he was downplaying the significance that program had.

Daring Fireball got ahold of leaked information from the meeting, claiming Tim Cook told employees 11 million customers had taken advantage of the program. In comparison, the company was accustomed to replacing in the ballpark of 1-2 million iPhone batteries per year.

### The Revenue Hit of 11 Million &quot;Significantly Reduced&quot; iPhone Battery Replacements

Making the cheap replacement batteries available had a cost for AAPL. For the 1-2 million batteries it would typically replace in a year, the company gave up $50 a pop in revenue by selling them for $29 instead of $79. But that's a drop in the bucket for a company like Apple. 

The real hit wasn't apparent until the new iPhones -- the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR -- launched in the fall. At that point, some 9-10 million Apple customers who may have purchased a new iPhone, instead enjoyed the renewed performance of their old device. With an average selling price (ASP) of $793 last quarter, that means those cheap iPhone battery replacements could have cost AAPL nearly $8 billion in lost revenue due to forgone iPhone sales.

That is remarkably close to the $10 billion that some analysts were predicting the iPhone battery replacement program could end up costing Apple last January, when it was first announced.

Obviously, not everyone who replaced their battery would have bought a new iPhone this year. However, based on Apple's revenue warning, the program ultimately had an overall cost that was much higher than the company had anticipated. And it was a cost that hit AAPL stock investors, albeit nearly a year after the program was first announced.

### Silver Lining

Apple paid a big price for batterygate, although the size of the bill is just now being realized. 

The admission it was throttling iPhone performance cost the company public trust, even if the reason was for performance and reliability. There was lingering suspicion the company's real motive was to encourage the sale of new iPhones. It lost money on millions of cheap iPhone battery replacements. And ultimately it may have lost billions of dollars in iPhone sales last year.

So where's the silver lining?

For one thing, the battery replacement program wound down at the end of the year, so the bath the company took on cheap batteries is over. Also, the customers who bought those cheap batteries remain customers. They didn't switch to rival Android smartphones. They will continue contributing to AAPL Services revenue, and there's a good chance that eventually they'll upgrade to a new iPhone -- the new battery just delays that decision. Expensive as it was, it appears that batterygate didn't cost Apple quite as much as rival Samsung ended up paying for it's exploding Galaxy Note 7 mess.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

## Netflix stock

2019 started on a solid note for Netflix (NFLX). In January so far, the stock has gone down in only one session out of total eight. As of January 10, the stock was already up 21.3% month-to-date before its fourth-quarter earnings release scheduled for next week. Many analysts, including from Goldman Sachs and UBS, have expressed their optimism on the stock in the last couple of weeks. In contrast, Citron Research seems to have a different view. Letâs take a look.

## Citron Researchâs view

Today, Citron Research said on TwitterÂ that Netflix âinvestors at this level as blind as Bird Box. Market cap up $45 bill in 12 days or 12 $DWA / 12 $LGF / 10 $ROKU / 5 Hulu.âÂ Citron was talking about Netflixâs surging market capitalization with its stock price rally. As of January 10, its market cap was at $141.6 billion as compared to about $102.0 billion on December 24.

Seemingly slamming Netflix bulls, Citron added that Netflix âto trade back to $300.â

On Thursday after the market closed, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan upgraded the stock to âbuyâ from âholdâ and raised his price target on the company to $410 from $400. Last week, aÂ Goldman Sachs analyst also expressedÂ optimism on the company.

## Could it hurt the stock?

Despite Citronâs negative views, investorsâ high expectationsÂ for the upcoming earnings and the majority of Wall Street analystsâ positive views on Netflix could keep its stock positive in the near term. However, a weaker-than-expected earnings report next week or weaker 2019 guidance could hurt investorsâ sentiment and erase these gains.

As of Thursday closing, other tech stocks (SPY)(QQQ) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), NVIDIA (NVDA), Facebook (FB), Roku (ROKU), and Microsoft (MSFT) were up 10.3%, 3.2%, 8.8%, 10.0%, 31.1%, and 2.0%, respectively, month-to-date while Apple (AAPL) has lost 2.5%. Meanwhile, Chinese companies Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) have seen 6.1% and 7.6% gains, respectively, in January so far.",2019-01-10,153.8,152.29,-1.51,-0.009817945,Don't move,2,20,321,24,7.476635514018691

As is usually the case over the course of CES 2019, a number of technology trends became clear.

What we saw at CES is a reflection of what Big Tech companies and Silicon Valley startups alike are planning to roll out throughout the last year of the decade.

  * 10 Virtual Assistants for the Future of Smart Homes 



To prepare you for what's to come, we've put together a list of the five biggest tech trends that were on full display at this year's Consumer Electronics Show.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Virtual Assistants Everywhere

Blame Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for kicking this one off when it first came up with the idea to put its Alexa virtual assistant in a smart speaker. That started a race to control the smart home with virtual assistants that reached new heights last fall when Alexa showed up in an Amazon Basics microwave oven.

However, CES 2019 proved that even last year's escalation was just the beginning. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division tripled its display area this year compared to last year's CES and much of that space was dedicated to showing off devices that support Google Assistant. 

Companies are now putting Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri and Bixby in everything from beds to toilets. 2019 is shaping up to be the year that virtual assistants are literally everywhere in the home.

### Laptops Are Exciting, Especially Gaming Laptops

Computer makers are always at the Consumer Electronics Show, but they haven't been generating all that much excitement in recent years. With smartphones and tablets at the forefront, computers have been a bit of a snooze.

But at CES 2019, PCs were generating buzz, especially laptops. A number of factors have converged this year including more efficient mobile processors and GPUs, the popularity of PC gaming and a year in which PC sales paused a long slide, led by laptops.

As a result, laptops -- especially gaming laptops -- were out in full force. And they were showing off innovative new designs, including thinness that would have been impossible just a year ago, unprecedented processing and graphics capabilities, eye-popping displays with virtually no bezels, new form factors, and plenty of LED lighting.

### 8K TV Is Coming

Do you own a 4K TV? As of June 2018, only 31% of U.S. homes owned a 4K set. That's not stopping TV makers from trying to push the next big upgrade: 8K.

There were plenty of high tech TV prototypes on display, from flat screens that roll up for storage to wall-sized sets, but 8K is the trend that manufacturers are betting on as being the next big commercial success. After all, with four times the pixels of a 4K TV (16 times the resolution of 1080p HD), the picture is dazzling and sure to lure in customers.

The big question is, where is the 8K content going to come from? At this point finding 4K content can be tough. The storage space and bandwidth needed for four times the pixels of 4K is going to be a challenge. Regardless, every big TV manufacturer was showing off 8K sets at CES 2019 with plans to roll them out to consumers this year.

### Apple on Television

There is another big trend in TV at the Consumer Electronics Show this year, and it has nothing to do with hardware, it's all about content. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking the unprecedented step of opening up its iTunes movie and TV show store to Samsung TVs, no Apple TV streaming box required. That's a huge source of 4K and HDR content now available to Samsung TV owners.

Apple also announced its AirPlay 2 streaming is being adopted by TV makers including Vizio, Samsung, LG and Sony (NYSE:SNE). This lets iPhone and iPad owners stream video from their device to the TV -- a feature that up until now required having an Apple TV connected.

  * 5 Retail Stocks Suffering Major Markdowns 



By making these moves, Apple is potentially giving up some sales of Apple TV streamers (which range in price from $149 to $199). However, the payoff is expected to come in the form of more iTunes revenue for the company's Services division, as well as a larger potential subscriber base when it kicks off its own streaming video service to take on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) later this year.

### 5G Hype

5G is the next generation cellular network that promises speeds 20 times that of 4G LTE. Wireless providers are also looking at it as a potential disrupter that could let them replace broadband internet access for homes. Smartphone makers are hoping 5G is the technology that spurs consumers to upgrade en masse.

Needless to say, 5G was all over CES 2019.

There's one big problem. Cellular networks that can take full advantage of 5G are very expensive, and rollout is progressing slowly. Carriers must install far more towers than LTE requires, and additional wireless spectrum must be purchased. 5G in 2019 is expected to be limited to a handful of large cities, with national rollout not picking up speed until 2020.

AT&T (NYSE:T) was the butt of jokes at CES 2019 for trying to take advantage of the hype by displaying 5GE logos on smartphones -except 5GE isn't really a thing, it's just a slightly enhanced version of existing LTE service. But that move shows just how much anticipation is building up around this next-gen wireless technology.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

## Netflix

Netflix (NFLX) seems to be back in January after ending the previous three consecutive months in negative territory. At around 12:40 PM ET, the companyâs stock posted a high for the day so far of $340.96, which was about 5.0% up fromÂ the previous dayâs closing. Before todayâs gains, NFLX was already up 21.3% month-to-date.

## Todayâs optimism 

On Thursday after the market closed, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan upgraded the stock to âbuyâ from âholdâ and raised his price target on the company to $410 from $400, reported CNBC. In his note to clients, Sheridan said, âWith content spend now at a scale of the major media companies and titles continuing to demonstrate outsized marketplace success, we see the moat around NFLXâs global positioning widening and its long-term secular winner status remaining intact.â

Last week, Goldman Sachs also expressed its positive views on Netflix and reiterated its price target of $400. According to another CNBC report,Â Goldman analyst Heath Terry said, âWe believe Netflix represents one of the best risk/reward propositions in the Internet sector.â The analyst also praised the online media providerâs âinvestment in content, technology, and distribution,â which he thinks should âdrive subscriber growth well above consensus expectationsâ globally.

## Previous upgrades

Goldmanâs target of $400 reflected 23.2% upside potential in Netflix stock from Thursdayâs closing price while UBSâs new target reflected 26.3% upside. The recent Wall Street analyst upgrades ahead of Netflixâs fourth-quarter results are helping it soar. The company is slated to release its fourth-quarter results next week on January 17.

Today at 1:45 PM ET, other tech stocks (SPY)(QQQ) Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), NVIDIA (NVDA), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT) were down 1.5%, down 1.1%, down 1.8%, up 1.8%, down 0.1%, up 0.9%, and down 1.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, digital media player maker Roku (ROKU) was down 1.6%.

## Apple and Starbucks

Today, the stocks of the US tech giant Apple (AAPL) and coffee store chain Starbucks (SBUX) fell. At 11:15 AM, Apple was down 0.8% while Starbucks was trading with 1.3% losses for the day. While the broader-market weakness could be a factorÂ driving these two stocks down today, letâs take a look at anotherÂ important factor.

## Goldman Sachs warned of China

Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst Karen Holthouse said in a note to investors, âThe recent AAPL [Apple] announcement (while potentially also product-driven) cited trade concerns/macro, and MCD [McDonaldâs] acknowledged softer trends in the region at a late November event,â reported CNBC. She added that Goldman Sachsâ âmacro team also expects a continued slow down in GDP, at least partially driven by consumption.â

Holthouse thinks Starbucks could be the nextÂ US firm to warn investors of Chinaâs slowdown. She downgraded her rating of Starbucks to âneutralâ from âbuyâ and also cut the price target to $68 from $75.

On January 2, Appleâs CEO Tim Cook, in a letter to investors, lowered the companyâs guidance for the quarter ended December 29, citing weakness in China among other internal factors. A continued slowdown in China might affect the future growth of many other companies.

Today at 11: 25, the S&P 500 Index (SPY) and NASDAQ Composite Index (QQQ) (VTI) both were trading with 0.4% losses. YUM! Brands (YUM) and McDonaldâs Corporation (MCD) were down 1.7% and up 0.1%, respectively.",2019-01-10,153.8,152.29,-1.51,-0.009817945,Don't move,5,14,241,24,9.95850622406639

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Scale

As we noted in the previous part, Apple (AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) have tons of cash. While Apple has looked at buybacks, Berkshire Hathaway has looked at investments and buybacks. Their massive size is another similarity between Apple and Berkshire Hathaway.

## Boon or bane?

For Apple, as Buffett noted during last yearâs shareholder meeting, there arenât a lot of acquisition opportunities that fit into its scale. Even with Berkshire Hathaway, itâs like a large mutual fund sitting on a $100 billion cash pile. Buffett has admitted that there arenât many opportunities to profitably deploy cash. The last major outright acquisition that Buffett made was in 2015. Buffett said that the deal was expensive. Buffett also discussed scale during last yearâs annual shareholder meeting. In response to a question, Buffett said that âthe problem that all of us has is size. Itâs harder to run even $12 billion or $13 billion, frankly, than it is to run $1 billion.â Scale is also a boon for Berkshire Hathaway. Scale helps Berkshire Hathaway look at big opportunities and major acquisitions.

## Banking exposure 

Buffett sold some Wells Fargo (WFC) shares in the third quarter in a bid to keep Berkshire Hathawayâs stake in the bank below 10% to avoid regulatory hurdles. Buffett added JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Berkshire Hathawayâs portfolio in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway also added some Bank of America (BAC) shares in the third quarter.

## Qualcommâs trial with the FTC begins 

Qualcomm (QCOM) has been inundated with antitrust lawsuits from Apple (AAPL) and several countriesâ regulators. The chip supplier has paid fines to regulatorsÂ in Europe, Taiwan, and South Korea related to antitrust issues, but it has appealed these fines. It even lost modem orders for Appleâs iPhones, which sentÂ its stock down 27% between October and December 2018.

However, Qualcomm stock picked up from December 24 onward after it secured sales bans on Appleâs older iPhone models in China (FXI) and Germany (EWG) for infringing its patents. This year will be an important one for Qualcomm, as its trial against the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) is set to begin.

In 2017, the FTC alleged Qualcomm of misusing its monopoly in the mobile chip market to force phone manufacturers to license its patents. The FTC also stated that theÂ company had violated its fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms by refusing to license its SEPs (standard essential patent) to competitors. The FTC accused Qualcomm of having exclusive arrangements with Apple that prevented competitors from selling their chips to the iPhone maker.

A ten-day no-jury trial between Qualcomm and the FTC started in a San Jose court on January 4 after settlement talks between the two failed. Investors should watch for the court ruling, as it could have significant implications for Qualcommâs business model and the smartphone industry as a whole.

## What if the court rules against Qualcomm?

If the court rules against Qualcomm, the latter will be forced to license its SEPs to competitors, which would affect its monopolistic position in the smartphone chipset market.Â Qualcomm could also be forced to change its licensing model and charge royalties on the selling price of the modem instead of the selling price of the entire device. Such a ruling would significantly impact Qualcommâs earnings, as it earns more than 80% of its profits from its licensing business.

Apple will be closely watching the courtâs ruling, as it has filed a similar lawsuit against Qualcomm in which itâs asking the chip supplier to charge royalties onÂ its modem price, not its device price.

Next, weâll consider a scenarioÂ in which theÂ court rules in Qualcommâs favor.

## Jeff Bezosâs stocks

In the previous part, we looked at how Jeff Bezosâs Amazon (AMZN) went on to become the worldâs most valuable company on January 7, 2019. The company managed to beat other tech rivals such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL) in terms of market value to top the list. As of January 8, Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Intel (INTC) had a market capitalization of $409.6 billion, $139.7 billion, $85.3 billion, and $217.9 billion, respectively. Now, letâs take a look at Amazon CEO Bezosâs Twitter (TWTR) investment.

## Jeff Bezosâs investment in Twitter

According to the data compiled by crunchbase.com, Jeff Bezos invested about $15 million in Twitter (TWTR) just over a decade ago in 2008 through his investment firm Bezos Expeditions. Back then, Twitter was not a publically listed company. The company made its debut on Wall Street with an IPO in 2013. Twitterâs IPO was priced at $26 per share. Its market price as of January 8, 2019, was $31.80, reflecting about 22.3% upside potential from the companyâs IPO price of $ 26.

In 2018, TWTR rose by 19.7% despite an industry-wide sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPY) lost 6.2% in 2018.

## Wall Street analysts on Twitter

According to the latest data by Thomson Reuters on January 8, only about 28% of the total 40 analysts covering Twitter recommended a âbuy.â The remaining 54% of these analysts were cautious and suggested a âholdâ on the stock, while the remaining 18% of analysts gave it a âsellâ recommendation.

Analystsâ 12-month consensus target price for the companyâs stock was $34.44. This target price reflected ~8.3% upside potential from its market price of $31.8 on the NYSE.

## Good buys for long term?

Aswath Damodaran, better known as the âDean of Valuation,â yesterday in an interview with CNBC said to consider NVIDIA (NVDA), Boeing (BA), and General Electric (GE) for long-term buys. The finance professor stated that the three stocks are currently undervalued and can make a sharp upswing if the broader market trends higher.

Damodaran said NVIDIA is a long-term growth company, and the stock is currently available at an attractive price. NVIDIA is among the most battered stocks in the semiconductor space over the last three months due to multiple headwinds including a decline in memory chip prices, softness in industrial and automotive semis, and the broader market sell-off in December last year.

On January 9, 2019, the closing price was $142.58, which is over 51% lower than its 52-week high of $292.76 attained on October 3, 2018. Damodaran believes that the stock price might decline further this year, but he would still bet on NVIDIAâs long-term growth prospects.

## Boeing punished for wrong reasons

The finance professor said that Boeing has been âpunished for all the wrong reasonsâ due to growing concerns over the trade war between the US and China. He told CNBC, âLetâs face it, you can substitute for Apple (AAPL). You canât easily substitute for Boeing.â He further added, âI donât think you can tar all these companies which have China exposure with the same brush.â

The companyâs China exposure and broader market sell-off in December led to a massive decline in its stock. The companyâs stock fell to a new 52-week low of $292.47 on December 26. Just within three months, it attained aÂ 52-week high of $394.28 on October 3. Since December 26, Boeing stock has made a remarkable recovery with gains of ~18%, but it is still down ~13% from its 52-week high. Damodaranâs optimism toward Boeing seems to be due to the companyâs huge order backlog and massive cash flow generating abilities.

## GE may recover significantly

Damodaran sees long-term opportunity in General Electric (GE) stock if CEO Larry Culp succeeds in offloading the companyâs underperforming assets and lowers debt. The worldâs largest industrial conglomerateâs (XLI) stock plunged drastically last year after the company reported a $23 billion loss for the third quarterÂ of 2018. Additionally, a high debt level of $115 billion and negative cash flows, further raised concerns over its liquidity crisis, sending GEâs stock down to the ten-year low of $6.66 on December 11.

However, Culpâs speedy divestment and spin-off actions have somewhat helped the company gain investor and analyst confidence. The stock has made a sharp recovery in the last one month and is up ~30% since the December 11 closing price of $6.75.",2019-01-10,153.8,152.29,-1.51,-0.009817945,Don't move,2,37,450,41,9.11111111111111

## Amazon

American e-commerce and tech giant Amazon (AMZN) became the worldâs most valuable public company (SPY) on January 7. As of January 8, Amazonâs market value stood on top at $810.0 billion, surpassing Microsoft (MSFT), which was at $789.1 billion. Googleâs parent company, Alphabet (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL) were in the third and fourth positions with $751.7 billion and $715.4 billion market caps, respectively. Now, letâs take a look at key stock holdings of Amazonâs founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos.

## Jeff Bezos

Bezos topped the Forbesâ listÂ of billionaires in 2018 at $112 billion. He was the only person on the list with over $100 billion in wealth. Bezos was followed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, in the second and third positions with $90 billion and $84 billion, respectively.

According to Amazonâs recent filings, Bezos owns about 78.86 million shares of the company, a 16.1% stake in the company. However, his wealth and investments are not limited to Amazon. He also owns stakes in several other private and public companies. In the next part, weâll look at the publiclyÂ listed stocks Jeff Bezos owns.

Apple, which became the worldâs first company to surpass $1 trillion in market value in August 2018, now stands at the fourth rank due to a massive stock decline in the last three months. In the fourth quarter of 2018, AAPL lost 30.1%, while its stock has lost about 4.4% in 2019 so far as of January 8. In contrast, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX), Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have risen by 10.3%, 19.7%, 3.9%, 8.7%, 1.7%, and 12.4%, respectively, month-to-date.

## US-China trade optimism

Markets cautiously gave a thumbs up yesterday to the renewed optimism that the US and China seem to be engaging in more meaningful talks towards sealing a trade deal. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated that both the economic powerhouses could reach a settlement âthey can live with, and that addresses all the key issues.â

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) was up 0.47% on January 9, whereas the iShares Dow Jones US Technology (IYW) jumped 1%. American technology giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) were up 1.7% and ~0.2%, respectively. American depository receipts of Chinese technologyÂ companies NetEase (NTES),Â BaozunÂ (BZUN), and IQIYI (IQ) were up 6.6%, 3%, and 1.8%, respectively, yesterday. Among the Chinese technology companies, notable gainers were HUYA andÂ Bilibili. Letâs take a look.

## Chinese tech stock rally

On January 9, HUYA (HUYA), a leading live game streaming platform in China, witnessed a sharp 6.8% rise in its ADRs (American depository receipts). The companyâs ADRs opened at $18.32 and rose to touch an intraday high of $20.20 in afternoon trading. Later on, HUYA ADRs declined marginally to close on $19.45, up ~6.8% from the previous close of $18.22.

HUYA ADRs were listed at $16.06 on the NYSE after its IPO in May last year. After soaring to highs of $46.20 after its IPO, the companyâs ADRs have significantly declined since then. Much of the decline was related to tradeÂ war fears and Chinese authoritiesâ decision not to approve new games since March 2018, which negatively impacted the game industry in the country. However, 2019 appears to be a different case. The companyâs ADRs have soared 23% on a YTD basis as of January 9.

Bilibili (BILI), another Chinese technology major, is a video sharing website involving a game, comics, and animation. BILI ADRs surged ~6.6% yesterday. The ADRs reached an intraday high of $16.37 on January 9 before closing on $15.75, up 6.6% from the previous dayâs closing price of $14.78.

Noted equity research company Morgan Stanley has expressed bullishness towards Chinese technology companies in 2019. Morgan Stanley revised its price target on BILI to $17.0. This price target revision implies an 8% premium on BILI ADRs closing price on January 9.",2019-01-10,153.8,152.29,-1.51,-0.009817945,Don't move,1,10,368,12,3.260869565217391

## President Trump

President Trump uses Twitter frequently, and his early morning tweets especially can set the direction for markets. Today, Trump pointed to the strong US economy in a series of tweets. Trump tweeted, âEconomic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today.â To be sure, US employment numbers released last week were quite strong. According to Reuters, âJob openings are outnumbering unemployed workers across increasingly wide swaths of the United States.â

## Steel 

Trump also shared a comment from Mark Glyptis from United Steelworkers, praising Trump for the level playing field. Yesterday, Nucor, the largest US-based steel producer announced a $1.4 billion investment into a new plant. Other steel companies have also looked at plant restarts and fresh investments to capitalize on the higher steel prices. Trump also tweeted, âTalks with China are going very well!â After his âTariff Manâ tweet led to a market-sell off, Trump has been quite cautious about his comments on US-China trade talks.

## Strong economy 

Nonetheless, strong economic numbers, fresh investments from steel companies, and progress in US-China trade talks seem to be making Trump happy today. US stock market futures (SPY) are also pointing to a strong opening today. Markets and technology stocks (GOOG) (AMZN) (MSFT) were rattled last week after Apple (AAPL) lowered its guidance. However, markets have since recouped their losses.

## Apple

Today, Apple (AAPL) stock closed with nearly 1.9% gains at $150.79. The stockÂ remained volatile as many Wall Street analysts expressed their views on the company. Plus, the ongoing USâChina trade talks, which entered their third day,Â remained in investorsâ focus. The S&P 500 Index (SPY), NASDAQ Composite Index, and Dow Jones rose 1.0%, 1.1, and 1.1%, respectively.

## Tim Cook talked to Jim Cramer

Earlier today, CNBCâs Jim Cramer interviewed Appleâs CEO Tim Cook. During the interview, Cook spoke about many key factors affecting Appleâs business lately as well as criticism.

Denying any possibility of consistent fundamental weakness, Cook said,Â âWe think about the long term. And so when I look at the long-term health of the company, it has never been better. The product pipeline has never been better. The ecosystem has never been stronger. The services are on a tear.â

While expressing his views about the recent steep drop in Apple shares, Cook noted that âIâm never surprised by the market, to be honest with you, because I think the market is quite emotional in the short term.â

On January 3, Apple stock fell by 10% after Apple cut its first-quarter guidance, mainly citing Chinese iPhone sales weakness.

Before Cookâs comments today, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi saidÂ on CNBC, âNo need to rush buying Apple today.â Sacconaghi suggested that Apple isnât inexpensive based on its relative valuation.

Today, other tech companies Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Netflix (NFLX) rose 1.7%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 3.3%, 0.6%, 0.9%, and 1.6%, respectively.

## Apple

Today, Apple stock (AAPL) has been trading on a positive note with the help of the broader-market recovery. At 1:35 PM ET, the companyâs stock was up 2.1% from its previous dayâs closing price while the S&P 500 Index (SPY), NASDAQ Composite Index, and Dow Jones were up 0.7%, 0.8, and 0.9%, respectively. Nowâ letâs see how Apple CEO Tim Cook defended Apple during his interview with CNBCâs Jim Cramer today.

## Jim Cramer interviewed Tim Cook

Earlier today, Cook opened up about criticism that Apple has received lately in an interview with Cramer. During the interview, Cook said,Â âIn terms of the naysayer, Iâve heard this over and over again, Iâve heard it in 2001, Iâve heard it in 2005, in â7, in â8, in â10, in â12 and â13. You can probably find the same quotes from the same people over and over again.â

While saying that heâs ânot defensive on it,â Cook still defended Apple, saying, âMy honest opinion is that there is a culture of innovation in Apple and that culture of innovation combined with these incredible, loyal customers, happy customers, this ecosystem, this virtuous ecosystem, is something that is probably underappreciated.â

Before Cookâs comments today, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi saidÂ on CNBC, âNo need to rush buying Apple today.â Sacconaghi suggested that Apple isnât inexpensive based on its relative valuation.

Since Cook cut Appleâs first-quarter guidance on January 2, the company has received sharp criticism and negative views from many popular analysts, indicating longer-term iPhone sales worries.
